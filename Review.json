We told the server we were on lunch break and we come from a company that is right down the road that always orders there so they usually work well with us and get us in and out in a timely manner....but not today! They were incredibly rude and put our order in late, like 15 minutes after we ordered. Then we asked where our food was and that we needed to leave soon, and the waitress said \"well if you need to leave you need to leave. I will get to go boxes.\" We were in shock. We asked for the owners and they weren't in, so we ffigure that's why the staff was so terrible today, but my group and I decided to never go back there. So if you go and are served by a young girl that dresses like she's going to a soccer match, run the other direction and eat somewhere else!

They were dressed nicely and showed us where the restroom was and the plugs at the table in case we had to wait for someone. Also, they provide free water bottles, which helped when I had a hangover the next morning on our way out. \n\nMy room had 2 full size beds in it and a bathroom that connected to the bedroom as well as a door that led to the main room. The place was absolutely clean- bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, living room. My supervisor's bathroom had a huge tub in it. Also, the coffee and tea was Starbucks, so that was a big plus. \n\nI love this place so much. It was safe at night, the bartenders were cool and friendly. They directed us to places to check out as well as noted the vibe. (Half the group wanted a ratchet time while the other half wanted a chill, \"shoot pool\" time.)

The rest is spent waiting.  Mainly for grilled cheese, which apparently takes 45 minutes to make.  Maybe they were furiously Googling the ingredients or something?  Who knows.  But for some reason it took an ungodly amount of time and was last to the table.\n\nThe service was also slow, mainly because as our waitress noted, they don't have trays so she couldn't carry drinks or food for 4 people, which resulted in multiple runs back to the kitchen and bar.  Which is understandable because it TOTALLY makes sense to not have serving trays in a restaurant.  I mean, how out of place would that be?  Trays?  In a restaurant?  I can't imagine.  That would be like having alcohol at a bar.  Too foreign a concept.\n\nAnyway.  I get it isn't the best or classiest place downtown, so I cut it some slack, but an obscene wait for food and a borderline inept waitress are two things you don't want to deal with on a Thursday when you are a hung over and hungry group because you all maybe had one martini too many the previous night.","date":1357142378000},{"review_id":"J4LVJg82TjwJmjJvwwJcOg","user_id":"EdJoFvhyRQnnGW7DT3ZLQA","business_id":"HUEZLPIM64cDZnfHE1H3AA","stars":5,"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"its the best pizza hut i'v found in florida always got great deals & offers the staff are very friendly & make you feel welcome and if you have children with you they make them feel extra special & welcome them in a huge way too","date":1222680784000},{"review_id":"5S0sOS6OD9RJRYVl5jz7ZA","user_id":"dUOZB3F9187M8UjbAxTAkQ","business_id":"Oj5Seggqo_2FfKSjcAg7yw","stars":3,"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"This place is pretty cool!

Something along the lines of aeu-de-someone-flooded-the-toilet. \nAfter unpacking--which I shouldn't have done, but I'm a sucker for any opportunity for sticking things out and making them work. We called the front desk. \nShortly thereafter, a housekeeper appeared with a spray bottle to investigate. She agreed that the carpet needed to be cleaned (which would happen the following day), and began spritzing, what I can only assume to be anti-mold stuff? I didn't ask--which clearly you can see from this point means I have some sort of timidness for communication. I really need to outgrow that. \nLong story short, by the time she had hosed down the carpet, walls, and doorways with her spray bottle, we were left coughing and choking on the fumes and were forced to spend the night with the door open in a weak attempt to ventilate the room.\nI did not leave my heart in FL. but I may have donated a small portion of lung tissue. \nYou're probably asking...\"but did you die?\" \nI am very much alive.

Their cleaning employees are nice people, but awfully unprofessional and with absolutely no training.  They are basically just told to show up. There are no standards by which they must adhere, even in regards to what supplies they bring.   \n\nThe last cleaner I had brought a single rag with stains and hair on it, to clean everything, even the bathroom...and no paper towels. I opted to give her my counter cloths to use for the kitchen at least, but couldn't find it after she left.. so I guess she took it with her!   \nSince she presumably used the same rag in the toilet as everywhere else... I had to clean AGAIN after she left. \n\nThe WORST part is the customer service and overall company interaction.  \n\nFirst cleaning  - I booked using a referral promo.   I have the screenshot of what I was supposed to be charged - when I made the booking. However the charge on my credit card was DOUBLE.  **Customer service said the quoted price was due to an error in their website design and thanked me for bringing in to their attention..but did not refund me the balance.   The cleaning was just ok, but I opted to give it another try..BIG MISTAKE.  \n\nThe second cleaning:  I had a scheduling conflict and moved the cleaning by 2 hours: the online system confirmed that I would be charged a $15 fee.  However, the schedule change did not take effect, they showed up when I was not home, and my whole payment was wasted.  **Customer service told me \"nothing was rescheduled\"...they don't know why the system did not register it..no compensation offered.\n\nThe 3rd cleaning: The pro, Omar, started by texting that he was running late.  Then he texted that he could not come due to police activity in the T and HIS WORDS: ' the situation is a lil risky for me'.    I called customer service and they confirmed that he would not be coming.  They told me they would refund my credit card the full amount paid for the cleaning and also issue me a $35 goodwill credit since my whole afternoon was wasted waiting for him.   \n**The credit card refund never showed up, and when I called 2 weeks later, customer service told me that they just gave me a goodwill credit because the pro 'was late'!  \nI told them that in fact he NEVER showed up **I have his messages to prove it, and I HAD been told I was going to get the full refund to my credit card.   \n**They refused to refund the full amount. I asked them if they have customer service calls recorded, so that they can go back to Sep 16 and listen to what I was told.  The woman told me that her manager said yes they have the calls recorded, but he will not listen to them, and that she was 'proceeding to cancel this call'.. AND SHE HUNG UP ON ME.  \n\nNeedless to say I will NEVER refer anyone to Handy.  I have never in my life dealt with such disrespectful and terrible customer service.  \n\nThe concept is great, their cleaners are nice but somewhat unprofessional, but the company values are extremely sketchy.   \nBottom line: Handy is a scam..a huge waste of money AND time.","date":1444254505000},{"review_id":"MLFBoCkhuOuF3bRllqVyiA","user_id":"FcJw5upAp2kpkEC9yjvkXA","business_id":"Je42YeoIWbMUQphd-UsKLA","stars":2,"useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0,"text":"Good may have been good if my server Megan T actually used a pad and took people's orders instead of guessing and just putting whatever she thought you wanted in front of you.

Our destination of choice?  Ma Soba, a pan-Asian and sushi restaurant in Beacon Hill.  Opened in 1999, the restaurant has an impressive array of awards.  Needless to say, we were pretty excited to try it out.\n\nWe were greeted at the door by a friendly face, but his was the last smile we would see that evening.  Our server ignored us for several minutes after stopping by just long enough to fill our water glasses, and when she did return, only wanted to know if we had \"decided what we wanted\".  She took our order and left.  Not that she didn't do her job well; she was tremendously efficient.  Our water glasses were full all night, and she timed the courses perfectly.  But a smile and a little hospitality certainly would have made us feel a lot more comfortable.\n\nWe hit a home run with our appetizers.  My boyfriend ordered the pork gyoza, and they were crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside.  My miso soup was excellent.  For our main course, we split the Shogun Boat, which consisted of eight pieces of Sushi, fifteen pieces of Sashimi, a Tuna Roll, a Caterpillar Roll and a California Roll.  Now, we knew Ma Soba was not the top sushi restaurant in Boston.  It's not too pricey, so we knew not to expect phenomenal sushi.  With that in mind, we were very pleased with the presentation, the selection and the quality.  We were quite content after our main course, even if our server had yet to crack a smile.  \n\nHowever, the biggest disappointment was yet to come.  We ordered the green tea mochi, and we were horrified when my boyfriend's fork made a resounding \"clank\" against  it as he tried to cut into it.  I attempted a bite of my piece, but after chunks of freezer burn ice fell into my mouth, decided to follow my better judgment and send the mochi back.  We were disappointed that the restaurant even served us such sub-standard fare.\n\nWe left disappointed.  The sushi itself was as expected, but the service, the awful dessert and the lack of ambiance in the restaurant ultimately left us unsatisfied.

Also there was a dance competition going on at the same time that seemed to bleed into our area.\n\nThe food supplied at lunches and dinner was good every time, no real complaints. A little better than standard hotel conference food- however one of my roommates for the conference was a vegetarian and she was not happy with the tofu option that was provided at EVERY meal.\n\nNext, I found the pool to not have very much space to accommodate enough people at all. We went outside at 1pm and found not one single spot to sit. This would dissuade me from coming back to this hotel.\n\nThe food in the restaurants was very expensive, hard to find  quick cheap lunch in our off time. Additionally, the bar they had open at night by the entrance to the hotel was VERY expensive for a drink. I am talking 13-17$ per drink. No thank you.\n\nLastly, my biggest issue was the bathroom in our hotel room. It was great and all that a TV was in the mirror- not gonna lie, that was COOL. However, there were slots in the bathroom door so there was no real privacy at all. It was like the slots on a closet door? I was rooming with some people that I was not as familiar with and I was turned off by this- especially for how expensive it is to stay here!

Upon arriving to the National garage at MCO, we did not see anyone in the attendant booth so we proceeded to \"choosing our car\" (I am an Emerald's Club member so we got to pick any car from the respective lane). The caveat is I had a car seat reserved as well for my little one. After we chose our car and had my family inside our chosen vehicle (garage is located outdoors and it's FL) I proceeded to head back to the attendant's help for the car seat. Still no attendant, waited another 10 min before someone showed up. When he finally came back, no personal greetings and was a bit short when I asked about the car seat, he pointed to a pile of car seats on a shelf and walked away. Forget about any type of help with installation.

In Oregon and Washington, sustainable eating is a bigger movement, and here at the Wave the focus is on fresh, seasonal food with huge flavor frequent organic influences...and the like.

We got there around 8 and there was a nice, pleasant crowd. The music often surprised me with a throw back from my childhood (hats off to the dj). All of the games are free to play and there wasn't a cover. The beers were reasonably priced and I didn't mind paying a little more since we were playing free games. The decor was impressive.

I eventually went for the awesome looking brunch menu and ordered way too much for two people:\n\n- Pulled Pork Corn Muffin ($6)\nThis is listed under sides, but it came out first and was a really delicious start to the meal. It's less like a corn muffin, and more like just a ton of pork with some guacamole on delicious bread.\n\n- Sunrise Poutine ($15)\nI told myself that this was a starter, so I wouldn't feel horrendous for ordering three entrees. This is way more than an appetizer and is a meal on its own. This consists of a hot pile of fries covered in scrambled eggs, gravy, cheese curds and Canadian bacon. I often regret ordering poutine when I'm left with half a plate of pure mush and sogginess, but that was not the case here at all - this was some of the best poutine I've ever had, as the fries remained super crispy throughout and were incredibly good combined with the salty Canadian bacon and the fluffy eggs.\n\n- Sunnyside Burger ($15)\nAs if we didn't get enough bacon, egg and cheese with the poutine, we also had this excellent burger with plenty more of the same piled on top of it. This was a really outstanding burger. The sunnyside egg on top was nice and runny and was just perfect with the bacon and American cheese.\n\n- Southern Belle French Toast ($12)\nAnother really excellent choice, this french toast came with two huge, juicy chicken breasts on top of it. The jalapeno jelly was a little strange, but aside from that, the chicken and french toast combo was just as good, if not better than the standard chicken and waffles.\n\nIt's a pretty hipstery crowd with hipstery, slightly lazy service.

We decided our current room was better. We had another minor glitch in that our fridge was not working, but that was fixed by giving us another working fridge in the room.\n\nShould I need to return to Orlando to be near the convention center, I would stay here again. The convenience factor is huge, but the service is what sold me. It was impeccable. Every single person is incredibly accommodating and nice! Really made our hotel stay and minor blips easy to get over. Although I wish the rooms had coffee makers. Another plus are those like me who do not have children. Luckily, there are two pools. The grotto pool is the huge one w\/ the waterfall close to the parking structure. The quieter lap pool is also large and catered more towards adults. I loved this area. While the husband was in his classes, I was relaxing by the pool. More hotels need two pool areas like the Peabody. I also got to check out the lovely fitness center (didn't use it), and used the spa twice. Wish the spa was larger with a hot sauna as well as the steam sauna.\n\nPeabody also has a few restaurants. I recommend Napa for lunch and dinners. B-Line Grill was gross and Capriccio not very good either. I also recommend self-park. I'm normally a valet girl b\/c I'm lazy, but every time we valeted, it was backed up and took forever for our car to come out. The parking structure is conveniently located a short walk from the hotel. It was faster and a bit cheaper to park this way.","date":1373674541000},{"review_id":"7phEXOkvB4iDsgj8wcGqgw","user_id":"WujXjjkUfb4N7cH5oXaoiw","business_id":"VImbIWfxODVsiRHebSQePw","stars":4,"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"I visited the Sam Adams brewery during a trip to Boston in September 2008.

When I washed my hair a couple of days after the keratin my new highlights were brassy blonde and completely burnt and shriveled up. I had to straighten my hair but it looked terrible! I went to the salon and elie agreed to fix it. He toned down the highlights and cut my hair really short trying to cut the fried hair out but it still looked terrible.

The next appointment I made with him he cancelled and I had to go to somebody else because I couldn't get another appointment for weeks. So when I was getting close to needing another haircut I went into the salon and made an appointment and I told him I was upset about all the money I paid for the keratin. He said we will talk when you come in for appointment. I went in the following week for my appointment on a Monday and he had called in sick.

It's my go-to healthy option for lunch and it's consistently good every time.  \n\nToday I strayed form the norm and decided on the veggie burger and un-fries (insert eye roll here, un-fries?).  I must admit that the fries are tasty.  They barely made it back to the office.  They were a bit oilier than I thought baked fries should be but that just made them tastier I suppose.  The veggie burger was ok.  Nothing to scream about.  I got it with everything on it which made it messy on the scale of a double whopper.  It had a bit too much of everything on it and some sort of seasoned salt on the veggie burger itself that was unevenly applied causing me to get mouthfuls of saltiness.  That being said the lettuce and tomato were very fresh and the bun was whole wheat and soft.  I think if I had scaled back on the toppings and asked for no salt I would have enjoyed it more.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my burger I noticed some other people's food coming out of the kitchen.

This particular Unos I've been to more times than I can count and I've had at least 3 other bad customer service experiences, but the one I had tonight takes the cake.  The guy I had twice before was so negligent that I got his name from my check and memorized it so that when I returned I'd ask that they seat me anywhere but his area.\n\nI came in today and asked for a one person booth for one and she says they don't have any so they had to seat me in the back where all the tables are.  Ok, no real problem, but I was there alone, and it wasn't peak hours just yet; it was obvious that I just wanted to eat and enjoy a meal with minimal disturbance or distraction.  And yet, she tried to seat me DIRECTLY next to another person at a table, even though the whole space where the tables were was empty.  I said no, I'd like to sit over there please (referring to a small table on the other side) and she obliged.  It just seemed like common sense and common courtesy to me.  Even in mall foodcourts, total strangers don't sit directly next to one another, let alone at an uncrowded sit-down restaurant.  \n\nThen, maybe 10 minutes later, they came back and seated a party of two DIRECTLY next to me.  It was extremely awkward because the rest of the area was just about empty and fairly quiet, and they were so close to me.  I was irritated; she easily could have sat them at any other of the 5 empty tables and the waitress assigned to that area wouldn't have been inconvenienced.  I was going to try to tough it out, but the woman at the table turned out to be particularly loud, borderline obnoxious in my opinion.  I put on my headphones (not earbuds, but headphones) to drown her out, even though I'd intended specifically to come there to read while I ate dinner.  Could still hear her loud and clear.  I tactfully asked the waitress if they had a table available up front, and she responds, \"no, they're all taken.  I can serve you here\" pointing to the table 4 inches to my right.  I responded \"No, that would be the same thing\", trying to maintain my tone of voice.  And though my request to be moved was clearly code for \"get me out of here please! NOW.\", she wouldn't oblige.  They lied.  There were tables available.  I discovered this when, only moments after they brought out my order, I quickly gathered all of my uneaten food and was walking out to leave with it.  They just didn't want to move me because of the inconvenience of either having to switch me to another waiter, or her having to serve me outside of her table area. \n\nMy whole issue really is that they don't seem customer service centered and reading some of the other reviews, they don't make common sense decisions with their customers.  3 distinct times I've walked out of there in a huff because of the treatment.  I also agree with some of the other reviewers, they tend to take a little too long, even when it's not crowded.  I wouldn't recommend this location at all just because the service is too much of a gamble, you never know what you're gonna get.  To be fair, the food is consistent and I have had some really good waiters here and there, but again, it's too much of a gamble.","date":1449289379000},{"review_id":"4LOBrUCcF2VeyfSaYXI7dA","user_id":"u_jUwvKEkyGzNP6q2wAR4Q","business_id":"aFD76viyy3AURuYnb_6A4Q","stars":4,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"I don't have time to haul over to Allston\/Brighton for Yi Soon bakery, so this is the perfect place for my more frequent visits to Chinatown.

I have been a VW enthusiast for over 20 years, so after moving from California and having a lot of options of independent mechanics I thought Full Throttle was the perfect transition after moving to Orlando. What I found was a shop that failed to do simple work and give me bad advice. I took my Passat in there for a brake job, simple rotor and pad replacement, when I asked the service tech I can't recall his name but he's the only guy answering phones and giving \"advice\", told me when I break in the new pads\/rotors I should accelerate as fast as I can like up to 60 mph and brake as hard as I can. Anyone who has common knowledge\/sense of brakes knows this is the opposite of what you're suppose to do, I just acted like he was right, as I knew it was a bad sign, he also proceeded to give somewhat of a guilt trip for bringing in my own parts. The other thing they did was flush my transmission fluid, oddly, he said it was low when they checked it and said I should bring the car back in a week or two to recheck the fluid level. As soon as I got the car back the transmission started to jerk, which had never done before. Having owned this car for 8 years I knew they had either messed something up or did not put back enough AT fluid, which is why he said come back? I took it to another mechanic I trust but is further from my house, he checked the AT fluid level and said it was 2 quarts low, which was causing the jerking during gear shifts. He filled up the missing fluid and the problem was gone. I will never go back to Full Throttle. I can see how people would be fooled to think these guys are VW lovers and treat people who drive dubs with some type of special treatment or loyalty, and that may be the case for some, but for me, based on talking and going to many shops over two decades, these guys are just full of themselves and want to act like they are the only alternative when it comes to working on dubs. I am disappointed because I was hoping I could find a VW shop I trust, but all I got was weird attitude, bad workmanship, and bad advice. I am writing this review because I think most of the reviews on here are written by shop friends in order to drum business. And I want to give an objective review of a bad experience that i think was not an aberration, but rather more the norm. Lastly, when I brought the car to my other VW mechanic who is now worth going out of my way to see. He found a coolant leak at the rear flange where it was completely rotted away. He couldn't figure out how the guys at Full Throttle missed it, because FT also replaced a leaking valve cover gasket, so he told me they should have seen the leaking coolant.

I was originally going to the Boylston St location but switched to the High St location for convenience. Therapists at this location are incredibly knowledgeable. The staff here consists of mostly male therapists, except for my therapist Lisa (And Kelsey? Who might only be there part time not sure). I actually prefer a more male dominant clinic, as I find that the atmosphere can be more relaxed while still keeping a professional tone.\n\nI work as a professional ballroom dancer and came in for two injuries (knee and shoulder). Lisa has given me a program geared very specifically to my athletic ability. The skill sets and quality of physical therapists can range greatly. I've been to clinics where I've felt that I was not being challenged enough given the physical demands of my sport. Lisa has designed a program to optimize muscle rehabilitation with a concentration on exercises geared specifically to increase blood flow and nutrients to my knee and shoulder. \n\nAside from being a great therapist, I find that Lisa is able to give a genuine warmth and sense of concern for her patients.  While I've been to a number of very qualified male therapists, I find that they can sometimes lose their sense of human connection to the patient and I end up feeling like a cow in a factory line. \n\nIn Lisa I see a great ability to empathize with patients, often putting their needs before her own. No matter how busy she is, or how early or late the day she always greets me with a genuine smile and a welcoming tone. \n\nAlthough I find all the exercise technicians to be competent, I have found Kyle to be the most knowledgeable and personable. He, like Lisa has a genuine care and interests in the well being of patients and is always very confident in his delivery of information on exercises. \n\nEric acts as a mentor at the clinic, and has really been able to hone in on microscopic details in my rehabilitation that has helped to propel my recovery process. \n\nJess, the clinic manger runs the best clinic I have ever been to. The office, while small is neatly kept, towels are always new, rug always clean, and table always sanitized.

First, be very careful to review the \"professional design\" they put together for you.  We had 24\" sections that the salesperson filled with 21\" cabinets and a 3\" spacer which look VERY odd.  In addition, the design shifted cabinets to leave odd spaces that don't look quite right.  instead of bringing any of this to our attention in the store, we were left to figure it out after the fact.  And we could have come up with some pretty simple, probably no cost -difference solutions.  The sales staff are friendly, but looking to finish your order to move on to the next as quickly as possible.\n\nSecond, they do not call back.  If they say they will call you, or schedule a delivery, be prepared to call them daily to ensure they do what they say they will.  It will be a one-way street of communication.  Guaranteed.  I have emails of promised delivery on a Friday, but a Friday follow up call discovers the warehouse person is gone and no one knows what is happening.  Follow up call on Monday, and promises that someone will bring it to me on their way home from work.  Follow up call on Tuesday, same promise.  Follow up call on Wednesday, and the delivery person is bringing it.  Delivery person shows up Thursday, saying he never knew anything about delivery until that morning. \n\nYou are paying for cabinets in a flat-packed box.  You get no information, no customer service, no call-backs, etc.  Plan on NOT getting the shipment on time when promised, and you should expect that it will be missing items with no idea when those items will arrive (a week?  6?). If schedule and customer service are important to you (and they should be!), this is probably not your first choice.\n\nAnd I agree with other reviews.  The cabinets are nice, but the price is not lower than other options.  Cabinets to Go is an option when shopping around, not a cheaper option.

They never seem to be very crowded when I want to go, usually on the early side. I do love the ambiance, which is like a nice little Parisian cafe. The night I went in to meet two other people, I was early, and sat at our table watching the sun slant into this lovely gem of a room. Very nice vibe....\n\nThey had 6 rose wines on the blackboard, from France and Spain as well as the US. I ordered a flight of rose for $15, and expected those dinky little two ounce shot glass kind of things. Imagine my surprise when I got fairly reasonable pours of all three. My friends came, and we proceeded to enjoy an amazing meal. We had the watermelon and tomato salad, the kale and brussels salad for apps. For dinner we black pearl salmon, the vegetable entree (that night it had cauliflower and chickpeas, and a slightly middle eastern flavor), and the rigatoni. The latter was mine, and I have to say,  it was gorgeous, with the perfect ratios and flavoring. I took leftovers home and ate them the next day for lunch, and it was just as good. \n\nThen, I dreamed about it two nights later.  No really----I dreamed about a pasta dish I had in a restaurant. I had to go back. \n\nWhen I went back, I tried the Saint M reisling, which was spectacular. I've been looking for a reisling that is very dry but still has the flavor, that floral, fruity thing I associate with the wine. I was with another diner, and she had the rigatoni while I had the risotto. These change fairly often---mine was with snap peas and other green summer vegetables. Risotto is always too rich for me, but here again, I brought it home and it made a great lunch.  LAter I discovered you can order a half serving of risotto or the rigatoni, which evidently has been on the menu for like 20 years. \n\nUnlike several other reviewers, I've found the service to be attentive and informed, especially about wine.  The servers also have personalities, so it's like talking to real people, not automated servant bots. Prices are, to me, very reasonable for the quality of food.

Everyone is herded into the houses in a continuous line, which really ruins the surprise element of the scares. We were always right behind the group that would be jumped at or surprised, so we weren't scared or surprised in the least.\n\nUniversal really needs to evaluate their capacity limit for HHN.

It was a $46 dish that tasted like a salty, squashed and seared frozen fish fillet. The veggies were stated as, \"from The Land\" in Epcot. Who knows if that's true, but they were under cooked. I like them with a bit of crunch but they were more hard than anything.\nThe New York Strip was ordered medium rare and it came well done. Our waiter said it was good that we sent it back because it was a viened piece of meat. This brings me to a different complaint. Why are the people that help us make our order not the ones that bring it to us? As a customer we are left wondering what to do until the waiter has time to check on us.  \nThe lobster tails were not the melt in your mouth that these Nova Scotians expected. Lesson learned, eat lobster where lobster is freshly caught.\nNow for the good - my husband LOVED the Chilean Sea Bass. The appetizer of Cheese Evolution was fun to try and share.

The dim lighting and decor is very classy and chic.  Despite having a reservation and the restaurant not being very crowded, we had to wait about 10-15 minutes before being seated.  Once seated, the waitstaff was very attentive and friendly.  Our waiter knew the menu well and was able to provide suggestions based on what my friend and I were in the mood for.  Because it was Dine Out Boston, there was a pre-fixe menu to choose courses from for $38, with several items to add for an up-charge.  We started with the tuna tartar, which was nice and fresh, although had a \"different\" flavor to it which I could not pick up on and did not love.  The quail yoke on the tuna tartar was neat, but did not provide much flavor.  We also shared the porcini flatbread, which was thin and crispy with a subtle mushroom flavor-not too overbearing.  I had the scallop entree, which came with four large, nicely seared scallops over mashed cauliflower, with roasted cauliflower, broccoli and golden raisins.  This dish was delicious and not too heavy-the waiter steered me in the right direction!  My friend had the bolognese, which was a mix of veal and oxtail, served over home-made rigatoni.  This was also delicious, with right amount of sauce over the pasta and a nice portion size.  For dessert, we shared the tiramisu with dolce de leche gelato.  It was good- but I was hoping it would be better, seeing we were in the North End.  The bottom layer was overly moist and the top layers were quite dry.  Overall, we had an enjoyable meal.  In the future, I'd like to eat outside as the seating is on the water.","date":1408908955000},{"review_id":"8eW8iDwuSjixTzNp5tznBA","user_id":"Un-DdNqEL_h2r4NeCoZS_Q","business_id":"Lg7aBaURc2MiAhM4ZJldvQ","stars":1,"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"This hotel was dirty, the pool had zero chlorine, the pools had a lot of hair, the rooms are dated, the sending machines had warm drinks, and the vacation rental program borders on hostile bullying.","date":1531000207000},{"review_id":"o_2RTLmaW0IVtW5dOV2Bow","user_id":"_yN80hBY6RkIcZVo5Vu_8g","business_id":"3cLBtLFiH8IRdlEy9S8RiQ","stars":4,"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"Very nice and clean place to eat.

I went with my son today (2\/23) on a class trip and he was very disappointed. \n\nFamilies with toddlers thru preschoolers: they have a great kiddie area that (when my kids were younger) they could play in all day. A big extensive net system that lets them play above the ground. Lots of little kiddie rides for them to go on and even a kiddie roller coaster (38\" and up)\n\nFamilies with older kids (I'd say 3rd or 4th grade and up) or without kids - the park turns more into a theme park for you with the three roller coasters, Mako, Kraken, and Manta. The height requirement is 54\" and they enforce it! \n\nFamilies that are just in it for the shows- there are a lot of them, with lots of different animals. \n\nHowever if you have kids that are too big for the kiddie area and not quite big enough for the actual rides and don't really care about shows--they may be bored.\n\nOn 2\/23 the one \"roller coaster\", Atlantis, my son (53\" and bitter, lol) could have gone on was out of commission the entire day. So he was stuck with bland rides that definitely didn't hold a candle to the roller coasters he was desiring. \n\nHe also wasn't into the shows, which--I mean after all the negative press, it's hard to get excited for and if you've seen one dolphin push a human around, you've seen them all.  \n\nThe food service was awful. I'll just say it. The park wasn't particularly crowded however we waited 30 mins for every food thing we wanted. I'm glad we brought our lunch bc I can't imagine how much more time we would have wasted waiting for food. \n\nThe cleanliness was average, the bathrooms were stinky but not disgusting. \n\nSo, before you set out, figure out who can ride what so there is no sadness on a day you're spending $80 ish per person just to get in the door.","date":1519425965000},{"review_id":"BgBnykUFIGaV6Iuyn4kYFA","user_id":"sL4zZQObC0nqbu3qZGJExA","business_id":"U9lrX8Nviajz-74dF6zL7g","stars":2,"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"WHERE DO I START? We brought the kids here for their first time, got there around 9:30 for a 10:00 opening and was glad when they opened early. However, it quickly went downhill from there. Once we were in the park, we got in line for Manta and were disappointed when the ride shut down for \"technical difficulties.\" That lasted for about 25 minutes or so and many people left. Once operational, the ride itself was okay, but actually too slow for my liking. We then proceeded to try some other rides (they only have four roller coasters) and when I say that EVERY SINGLE ONE had an issue, I am not exaggerating! Kraken and Journey to Atlantis were both also experiencing technical difficulties, and Mako was temporarily shut down (when we were next in line) for an unexplained weather event as it was not raining, thundering, or lightning!!! Dark clouds should not shut down rides! Anyway....\n\nAt Journey, we'd just gotten our locker that the attendant told us we needed and when we came back he rudely told us and others that the ride had shut down and to go see guest services if you have an issue with getting money back for your locker as someone inquired. The bright side here is that we basically walked right up to everything as it was not crowded at all, which I may now understand why not. We left Journey to ride Kraken which was the best ride they have so we were able to ride it back to back as NO ONE was there! By the time we got back to Journey, it was fixed. One thing we didn't like about it was all the signage warning you that something was about to happen. No surprises here like it used to be! It kinda took the fun out of the ride.\n\nOn a positive note, we saw the Dolphin and Sea Lion shows which were pretty good and all of the aquariums and animal encounter exhibits were well done. I personally loved Antarctica and the penguins and how they let us ride into their habitat. That was really cool. \n\nLastly, the park closed at 6 PM but they started shutting stuff down (stores, carts, etc) at 5 PM to try to usher you out of the park. An employee told us this when we asked why it was already such a ghost town. I have been to many, many, theme parks and have never seen anything like it. To sum it all up, my teenager described it as a broken down Six Flags, but way worse.

My boyfriend and I both ordered the Breakfast Club. I loved the tater tots, those were delicious, but I found the sandwich itself kind of clunky and dry. The chicken breast wasn't heavily battered, so it tasted more like a slightly floured piece of chicken as opposed to the crunchy \"KFC style chicken\" I'd been expecting. The egg was also overcooked, although I probably should've asked for over easy. But basically there were two layers of the sandwich, or three pieces of waffle bread. I thought there would be a tomato or something else with moisture in it since the egg wasn't runny, but no. Because of this I found the sandwich very difficult to eat, I had to drench the entire thing with all of the maple syrup I was given and that still wasn't enough.\n\nMy family seemed fine with their choices, and I actually had a pretty good time here despite the mediocre sandwich. I might come back again, but with a different order.","date":1429085167000},{"review_id":"_ku090fnUgY3xW6MS0YUSQ","user_id":"uDz-zUN53zifezT9Jzi5tw","business_id":"BOzdu1Rv8ootQpnSBdhrng","stars":4,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"My favorite part of Beantown Pho is the atmosphere and the thai tea of course.\n\nTheir drunken noodles are in chili basil sauce but it was definitely worth trying.

We narrowed our choice on a specific car. We got an offer from a different dealership but decided to go to HC, since they were closer, and to offer them to sell the same car to us for a comparable price. \n\nWe call them and ask them if they have this car on the lot. They say: yes, several of them. We go there. The guy we talk to (Keith?) has the sleaziest demeanor. His entire desk is full of pictures of his family (and by full I mean like 20) and awards saying \"master of excellence\". I'm sure he has a Ph.D. in Awesomeness, too, but he doesn't have physical space to display that.\n\nHe tells us we want a good car, which everybody wants , but the trouble is (wait for it!) no dealer in New England has it. He is able to check that. No, really. Since we had an offer we told him we would check that other place first... unless he wants to give us an offer. He says that other dealer is lying to us that he has a car and that he needs to go and check if they will be able to get that very rare car for us and THEN we'll talk price.\n\nLet's pause for a minute. Suppose you're a Honda dealer and you honestly don't have a relatively popular car. Wouldn't you start your day by calling whomever and find out when the next arrivals will be? I mean, you do expect customers inquiring, don't you? Of course, you would. Either he didn't have a car or he knew he didn't want to sell it to us at the price that we wanted. Either way he was lying to us.\n\nSo he left the desk, and we checked our emails for a while and then we simply got up and left. I know they think if they waste enough of our time we will feel like we owe them for the big trouble that they went through on our behalf. Like I said... I guess it's working on some people. Why else would they try it on us? As we were walking to the door the receptionist tipped the salesman that we were leaving and he ran after us but we didn't stop. He called me like 8 times and I didn't answer.\n\nWe went to that other place the same day and bought the car. \n\nIn summary: do research online, BID ONLINE. Don't ever go to the dealership without a firm price promised and a VIN of the vehicle that they say they have. Never trust a car dealer to tell the truth. Doesn't mean you should fight them. But if the only way you know something is through them telling you then you simply don't know it. Always, ALWAYS, be prepared to walk out at any stage. Some people say, signing should take hours. FALSE! Tell them you will walk out if they do one wrong move AND MEAN IT. They will do ALL paperwork in less than an hour. Most of us want cars that are in abundance. Understand that and you will immediately understand that you should be the one in charge during the whole process.\n\nHere's a more detailed account of our buying process: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/silko-honda-raynham#hrid:k-v7aipcorfBAbBVzwWKcw","date":1311866681000},{"review_id":"WVpJiCYPXheRHm9tnckApA","user_id":"SbRnWwJ1xPxeeSS7j9BJIQ","business_id":"zyr68M7lzjC8iAk-c_RQdg","stars":1,"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"The food was good but Worst service I ever had! \n\nWhen I say bad I mean bad!!!!\n\nI had to get our menus, silverware,and remind them we ordered drinks.\n\nWe were there for like two hours.

The atmosphere is a bit nicer than the usual joints in this area, a place you don't have to warn people about before taking them here (date night perhaps?). The menu's pretty extensive and everything looked good, and I was intrigued by the 7 courses of fish and beef they had on offer as well as the wide variety of bubble tea and slushies. \n\nMy friends swear by the pho here, but I rarely deviate from Bun with Pork when I have Vietnamese (which is probably my favorite kind of pork EVER), and last night was no exception. One note is that Pho Hoa's Bun didn't have just pork as an option, so I had to go with the pork plus spring roll... I have no problems with the spring roll, it's kind of like getting a bonus app with your entree, but that extra fried bit tends to put me over the edge of fullness so I usually prefer just the pork option (plus the pork is my favorite part so the more of it I can get, the better). My Bun was delightful (it looked especially impressive here for some reason, the components were arranged so artfully), but I could have used a bigger container of nuoc cham, and also prefer my nuoc cham with slightly less red pepper flakes. But overall a solid tasty version with no major complaints from me, and comparable pricing to anywhere ($7.75). My dining companions of course really enjoyed their pho, and it did look good. Also, they served us cold tea, which was really refreshing on a hot summer day and a nice unique touch.\n\nService was spotty here though, they were good when we first arrived and our food came speedily, but we couldn't find anyone to initially take our order and then to get\/take our check, which was annoying. I'd say Pho Hoa is a solid choice when you're looking to be in a bit more upscale environment, but I don't plan on turning my back on Pho Pasteur any time soon.","date":1306505018000},{"review_id":"vWtKx_e9aCnxNUv1iw50EQ","user_id":"51SzvpuYXsIXdc13w0jcEQ","business_id":"eunDJzt-UmkHNyqQ13h5Uw","stars":2,"useful":0,"funny":2,"cool":0,"text":"Pretty sure my boyfriend got roofied here.

It was easily the best Christmas present to myself. Although the process started back in November because I was just informed of their layaway plan thanks to a friend. Black Friday weekend she offered to put money down for me on them because I was stuck at work. \n\nI returned about a week later to see them in person and was acquainted with the JV crew. Ali helped me out with them but I discovered that my massive hulking calves weren't going to fit. :( *proceeded to cry bacon grease* But Ali assured me that not only does John have a tendency to make the calves small on his boots but they CAN be stretched. She also showed me a few other styles that I enjoyed but I still had my heart set on those tall distressed purple boots. She reccommended coming back in a skirt because my jeans were really thick but painted on. \n\nI came back on my next free day and was helped by Pete. He helped me get my massive calves into those boots. One thing I really appreciated about Pete was he was quite practical and not the slightest bit sharky. In fact, he talked me out of paying them off right then and there until after my reviews at school. Massart Alumni know what's up. \n\nSo I came back the following weekend after getting paid and school was finished to finalize the sale and start the stretching process which took a little under a week. The soft distressed leather stretched quite easily and they fit perfectly afterwards. I was also later helped out weather proofing them and given advice on general care. I could also change the soles out on an older pair of heels I had. Just overall amazing customer service! \n\nAlthough now every time I come in, I'm tempted into buying more shoes.

For those of you that are unfamiliar with the DDP it is a prepaid dining package that you can purchase if you are staying in a Walt Disney World resort. Essentially you pay for your meals in advance and if you are a crafty diner -like me- you can really get a lot of bang for your buck and end up saving some money in the long run. So take my review with a grain of salt because I went BIG at Artist Point and did so without regret. \n\nOf all the WDW eateries Artist Point is firmly entrenched in my top three. Artist Point gets huge bonus points for featuring an extensive wine selection from the under appreciated Pacific Northwest. I'm a pushover when it comes to a good wine pairing and always ask my server to match a glass to each course. Since they are trained in this and I am not I leave it to the professionals. \n\nI am a big fan of the artisan cheese course and like a typical American I treat this as an appetizer instead of an end of the meal treat. The trio of cheeses covers a safe yet broad selection of fromage including a nice cheddar, a creamy goat and a tangy blue. This was matched nicely with an Oregon Pinot Noir. \n\nThere are two dishes Artist Point is famous for; the cedar plank salmon and the buffalo. Choosing between these two wonderful dishes is almost a Sophie's Choice caliber decision. Of course if you know that Artist Point has an off the menu surf and turf option where you can have both you won't have to decide. It's kind of like getting your burger \"animal style\" at In-N-Out because unless you know to ask for it you wouldn't know it is there. Both dishes are wonderful and served in smaller portions when combined so you can enjoy both without being wasteful. \n\nDesserts leave a little to be desired at Artist Point. The signature berry cobbler just doesn't do it for me. The chocolate cheesecake and the clafouti (a rustic baked custard pie with fruit) are better choices.\n\nArtist Point is a popular restaurant so make sure yu contact Disney Dining for a priority seating time.","date":1228279912000},{"review_id":"TVw5otqj2XXdfrK18xys3w","user_id":"X_oHTgTXZo_C5i6dCRqWyA","business_id":"Hf32W0LKC5lJZ1U0ADIC-w","stars":2,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"Went there on our last vacation day, thought it would be interesting.

A couple months back, I had the pleasure of going to the Water Grill in downtown Los Angeles, a restaurant that holds 1 Michelin star (at least when they had a Michelin guide in LA).

The mussels on the other hand were spectacular. We agreed that these were some of the most tender mussels that any of us had ever had, and they were quite flavorful as well. \n\nFor our entrees, my aunt and uncle both ordered some fish that they had never tried before, ordered the salmon, and my girlfriend ordered the lobster roll. The lobster roll was quite good and very lightly dressed (the way I like it). She also had coleslaw and fries on the side. While the coleslaw was pretty standard, the fries were very good. I loved that they decided to opt for tarragon and cilantro on the fries. For my salmon, I have to say that this was easily the most crispy fish skin I have ever had on a piece of fish. The fish itself was quite tasty as well. Oh...and the sauce...the sauce, so good. The chorizo added an element of saltiness that I thought was welcome and often lacking from fish in restaurants.

I spent that $10 for you, readers. And didn't finish my watery dark and stormy (was there actually alcohol in it? I couldn't really tell). I was seated at a corner table downstairs, underneath an overhang. My brother only bumped his head on the ceiling once or twice, and the protruding corner after one beer. The beer list was decent (saving grace?).\n\nWe split the fries with truffle oil for the appetizer, I had the tuna salad, sister-in-law had another salad, and Bro had the much hyped lobster mac n'cheese. Hm. \n\nThe fries were hot, that's always nice.

This might be a nice thing to get if you're just there for a drink or two (get beer or wine for yourself, seriously, avoid the mix drinks) and want something greasy to go along with it. \n\nThe salads were decent but overdressed--the lettuce on mine was good lettuce but I couldn't taste it because of all of the oil! The tuna was done really well, though, by really well I mean almost completely rare, which is how I roll with tuna steak. Maybe a straight up tuna steak would be good at this place, I'll never know. \n\nOk, on to the Mac N'Cheese. Seriously guys? All those people who raved about this stuff--do you really like the cheese to pool at the bottom of the bowl rather than being thick enough to be included in each bite of the food?? The taste was decent (I mean, cheesy lobster is really tough to eff up) but I thought the consistency was pretty nasty. The thin creamy cheese didn't make sense in a signature dish, and my brother started to wonder if he even likes mac n'cheese at all after how bummed he was about his meal. Trust me Bro, let's go to Zaftigs and get some real mac n'cheese before you make up your mind on that one.\n\nI don't plan to go back to this place.

I am a huge animal fan and for anyone else who is, you MUST stay at either the Animal Kingdom Lodge or the Villas within the lodge.\n\nNothing is more amazing then stepping out on your balcony and seeing animals. We had a balcony with a pool view that had luscious greenery abound with some animals in the distance. If you stay here, or even if you just go for a meal at Sanaa, Jiko or Boma, take a walk around the property! That's an order! Outdoors is absolutely beautiful. It is so fun going around checking everything out from the animals roaming around to the cool rockers placed around the firepit. They read stories some evenings. Also, when night falls, be sure to go to the night viewing spot and check out the animals with the night vision googles. It's a lot of fun!\n\nThe hotel itself is beautiful as well. The lobby is magnificent with amazing decor throughout. Get a tour of the AKL if you can!  There are super comfy chairs everywhere. We relaxed while waiting for a Boma dinner one evening in the couches, just taking in the atmosphere. There are some comfy chairs around an indoor fireplace which my friend actually fell asleep in front of as I was reading the story behind it. Plus, there are a couple of big balconies that overlook animal viewing areas which make for some fun!\n\nWe stayed in a Studio Villa which was huge! It had everything we could need...free Wi Fi (this is villas only), coffee maker, microwave, sink, fridge, all the mini kitchen fixens. We had our big bed plus a nice couch, table, flat screen tv, tons of space for the two of us. Plus, I loved the Animal themeing to the rooms (I will post pictures). The beauty was in the details of the room and hidden Mickeys were abound!\n\nI loved Boma their 1 TS restaurant, Jiko their 2 TS restaurant is simply amazing, I haven't yet tried Sanaa, and Mara their quick service area is great as well. \n\nThe pool is so beautiful! It's as if it's plopped write in the middle of Animal Kingdom---trees and greenery everywhere!\n\nThey have the usual great Disney staff throughout. I love their gift shop, as well! \n\nThe only downfall is it's one of the few Disney Deluxe Hotels that you have to take a bus everywhere. It's close to Animal Kingdom but not too close to the other parks so there are no boats, monorails, or walking paths to the parks. However, we had zero problems with waiting forever for buses here or anything like that.","date":1290392748000},{"review_id":"zMIJak52hakJUs6W2ZxJqg","user_id":"QhpD_YU3_RDMKjkH5DXMYg","business_id":"az0DEo7NfL1Y8IKxLD1L_A","stars":2,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"Don't like to do a Yelp that's less than 3 stars normally.

It'd been 3 years since seeing a dentist and I wanted to start getting back on track. Staff was nice, but very busy. Got x-rays, had an exam with a hygienist, all was fine. The dentist then came in, looked at my x-rays and my permanent retainers (top and bottom) and said that he wanted to take the retainers out. Okay, that was fine, I was interested. The only problem, he said, was that due to shorter roots on one of my lower incisors, I was likely to lose a tooth. This apparently didn't faze him.\n\nHe started talking about bridges and implants, then asked if I knew what a veneer was. I said no, and he directed the nurse to show me a video on it, then left. With no further explanation, I was forced to watch a video of a veneer being installed, in extreme close-up. If you don't know what a veneer is, it's when your teeth are all ground down and they install 3\/4 crowns on all of your teeth. Watching teeth being ground down is basically a scene from a horror movie. I was pretty appalled. Following that, they showed me an estimate for the removal of the permanent retainers (fairly inexpensive), a bridge (very expensive), and a night guard (very expensive), totaling nearly $4k. I left, shaken and convinced that I was going to lose a tooth and a LOT of money.\n\nI ended up getting a second opinion at Conway Dental Care (to which I have now transferred). The dentist there asked if I had any pain (something the dentist at Bright Now didn't bother asking), and I said no. \"If it's not broken, don't fix it\" he said, after inspecting the retainers to make sure they actually weren't broken. He said that I just need to come in for a regular cleaning and they'll be fine. This was an immense relief that my new dentist didn't pressure me into getting a needless procedure that risks losing my teeth!\n\nTLDR: Be careful with Bright Now - while the people who work there are plenty nice, the dentist will likely recommend unnecessary procedures without regard to your comfort, just to make a buck. Beware of large clinics. Get second opinions when you can.\n\nAlso: I can't speak to the quality of their work, as I have not had any work done here, just got scared off by their consultation.","date":1477495416000},{"review_id":"jnip66CTu3KNaI-waE-9uA","user_id":"w3bcOAGhSRd_CVpoAIA5hg","business_id":"3JrdnGYWUzUzepplmi7HlA","stars":5,"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"Loved this little spot by my house!

Stayed here on a whim because the description looked so promising. So many pools, so much to do, so many activities. This is a time share resort where they want very much to sell you ownership, and these places and their high pressure sales techniques always leave me uncomfortable. \n\nThe place is so huge that it ought to have its own zip code. The streets are narrow, so there appears to be even more cars and bodies around. Check in time is at 4pm. Then you get taken to the overly friendly time share salesperson, who invites you to breakfast and won't take no for an answer. They extract $20 from you to make sure you show up. (After seeing the place, I sacrificed my $20.)  Finally, a bellman has you follow his golf cart in your car to find your room. By that time, it's 5pm. \n\nWe were excited to bring the kids to play on the 18 hole putt putt course right on property. Sounds much better than it is. However, when we got to the club rental place, they told us all equipment had to be back by 5:15pm. We had 6 minutes if we cared to use them. Of course, checkout time is 10am. Which us fine if you want to get to the parks, but means you have to get up at the crack of dawn to use the other facilities. The golf stand didn't open till 9. Ok, one \"resort fee\" not put to good use. At least the pool we swam in was well heated. \n\nThe room was disgusting, including countless hairs belonging to past visitors (owners, perhaps??) on the sheets, blankets and tub. The towels were threadbare and had rust stains that looked like streaks from somebody's butt (nice), and the shower had a crusty dried booger on the wall. We were in the \"deluxe 1 BR suite\", but I can't imagine it was any different than the cheaper studio. Scammed again. \n\nI would rather spend a night in my car than stay here again, and I would no sooner buy than repeatedly poke myself in the eye.

I wish there had been a little more communication about what kinds of pics yield the best results because I would have brought more options then.\n\nI also had some simple nail art done - highly skilled artists that gave me exactly what I was looking for, but paid just over $100 for a relatively \"simple\" set (no charms or crazy nail art) which was a little surprising. Their quality is top notch though, and definitely worth a visit if you love Japanese nail art.","date":1538657696000},{"review_id":"5g2_LEgjsodBvMiHy1mxzg","user_id":"ALe7U_qKyxMilPLV1kOB0g","business_id":"6fF-nAA2AWTPYF2vlOzqtg","stars":5,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"text":"Still the best place around to get pizza.

He rushed through the exam  - failed to ask about dilation,  failed to use a reading card etc - and shuttled  me in and out of the exam room at 2 min increments  (he was also \"examining\" several other patients during the same 15 min stint.).\n\nOn top of that, he engaged in aggressive sales practices - my understanding was the doctor was supposed to have no interest or financial stake in the sales of glasses\/lenses.

This was a special and I wish it was on the daily menu. For $30 it's a steal! My husband had the ribeye with fresh grilled veggies. He ordered medium rare which was very pink on the rare side.

They made us feel unwelcome and discriminated against as non-white Americans.\n\nMy family and I had made in person reservations midday for an 8 pm dinner for a party of 3, where we left our name and contact number. We arrived at the restaurant for our dinner at 7:55 pm - where we were told it would be 15 min before we could be seated. So we ambled around the neighborhood and returned at 7:10, proceeded to wait in front of the restaurant and at 7:15 went in again to ask about our table. We were brusquely told by the hostess it would be another 5 min at least. So we walked down the block and returned again at 7:20 and went in to check on our table again. This time the waitress simply said she had given our table to another party because we had missed our reservation! They had JUST been seated. She was rude and unapologetic, blaming us for not being at the entrance when the table was ready. When asked if they tried calling our number given we had checked in with her 2x, she simply made us feel like we did not understand how things worked. Her demeanor was disrespectful, righteous, and truly disheartening.

The restaurant  has three dinning rooms and is very spacious so we didn't have wait long for our table. During the short walk to our table we got a brief description of the room we would be dining in. We dined in the Grand Gallery which was very decorative with beautifully designed lantern animals on the wall that followed an animal\/planet conservation theme.\n\nWe were then greeted by our server who gave us a rundown of the menu. I had made sure to mention to her that it was our second time dinning at Tiffins, just in case there were any changes made from our previous visit. (We liked it that much we had to come for a second visit). She informed us that there had been a few changes to the menu such as replacing the Duo of Lamb with the Duo of Venison and switching out the Grouper for a Swordfish.\n\nAfter thinking long and hard about the menu, we finally decided on two entrees: The Pomegranate -lacquered chicken and the Seared Hokkaido Scallops.  As we waited for the food to come out, the server brought out some complimentary bread for us to snack on. It was Pomegranate Focaccia bread, and let me tell you, it was very unique and delicious. It was not too fluffy, but a slightly more dense type of bread. It also was also lightly glazed with a molasses sauce which gave it just the right amount of sweetness. In addition to that, there was a dipping sauce made of molasses, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and hints of pomegranate which gave it the right amount of tanginess. The server had told us to use it sparingly because a little went a long way. But It was so delicious! We even got seconds on the bread.\n\nMy entr\u00e9e was equally as delicious.  The food was plated beautifully and the taste was on point.  The chicken was nicely flavored and moist. It pretty much fell off the bone and went great with the Sweet Potato Pap. The Thumbelina carrots were also super cute and yummy.  The Fennel salad was a great compliment to all the flavors and textures of the dish.  I tried a piece of the scallops and they were so good! We also ordered a side of Brussel sprouts which came in a pretty decently sized considering it was a side.  There were bits of bacon pieces in the Brussels which made it even better!\n\nOverall, an excellent dinner filled with great food, great service and a very warm and welcoming atmosphere. The prices are a little on the higher end, but all very worth it. Located right outside of the new Pandora attraction. It's perfect if you are looking for a fine dining experience in Animal Kingdom.","date":1496779505000},{"review_id":"H89gXYYZzW7uZVh8iGH5SQ","user_id":"CNaHLXC45cR07vtDeFYeww","business_id":"0BGoel6on7yGvojzOqOEAQ","stars":3,"useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":2,"text":"Tiffins is an upscale restaurant located in the middle of Disney's Animal Kingdom.  We were excited to eat here before trying to catch the Rivers of Light show.  \n\nOur dinner reservation was at 5:40 since we were trying to catch the 8:45 show. Unfortunately we arrived about 20 minutes late due to the bus running late.  Fortunately they were able to accommodate us.  The inside of the restaurant is really nice, each room is a different art gallery dedicated to conservation.\n\nI figured that still arriving at 6 would be plenty of time for the show but for some reason the hostess had us wait.  This was strange since it was very empty.  15 minutes later we were seated.  \n\nHaving been on safari in Africa I was excited by the menu as it had a lot of exotic meats.  We started with the charcuterie platter as a starter. I went with the duo of venison which had a venison filet and boerewors (South African sausage).  My wife went with the SA lobster enhancement and the Gobi cauliflower.\n\nI would say i was a little disappointed by the platter and my entree.  The starter was very small and the vension and sausage were not bad but served cold.  I will say that the lobster was amazing and so was the Gobi.\n\nI think the worst part of the restaurant has to be the service.  From the lackadasical hostess to the waiter which took FOREVER for dinner service unbelievably we did not make the 8:45 show.

Threading also lasts 3 weeks whereas plucking... two days maybe. I was very impressed when I opened my eyes. A flawless finish - I have never seen my eyebrows look so good before!

It seems like they're trying really hard to be this dive-ish, hipster-y kind of place but the fries are kind of forgettable.","date":1443076191000},{"review_id":"2S5jUUFaoQDGVLNzzvI5Ag","user_id":"91vuBK2s_mPgw-FEDBRDeQ","business_id":"oseNPKndpybN2ZfvXzDyWQ","stars":2,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"The food here was mediocre at best.

While on vacation in Orlando I took to yelp to find us a good dinner after being sick of eating theme park food for three days! When I saw border grill I was sold. Hole in the wall local places are my favorite! Especially considering I work in one so that might make me a little biased:) \nWhen we got there it was packed and it made me so ready to eat some good food! All the reviews I read said you order at the counter so we walked up and stood there for a while while the girls were busy behind the counter filling drinks and using the register. We patiently waited but no one looked up.. Maybe they were too involved in their work, I don't know. Eventually a girl walked by and said have a seat anywhere you'd like. Okay, so we sit outside at one of the only available tables in the place. I made eye contact with our waitress (the one who told us to sit anywhere so she knew we were wanting to eat there) at least 3 times and still she never came out for AT LEAST 5 minutes. Being a waitress this is unacceptable leaving a table sitting not greeted that long. We listened to the table behind us complaining about the time they had been waiting for their food. Finally they wave her outside and she talks to them, apologizes for the wait and gets their food out promptly. We then think... Okay this is it she's going to acknowledge us. Nope she just walked by again. Finally when she brings them some drink refills she walks by and says are you wanting to order? Um well we need menus we've never been here and she says \"oh you want to dine here?\" \nWho knows maybe sitting outside means you want it togo but I was assuming we could sit anywhere like she said and that was the only place that had open tables. \nAfter we got menus and drinks everything went smooth from there- \nWe used yelps check in deal to get free chips, salsa and queso! Added bonus- we got a little guacamole too! My husband is a huge queso fan so he devoured that. I was partial to the guacamole so we were both happy with that. we both ordered the Chicago burrito recommended from fellow yelpers and they did not disappoint! I ordered mine with shredded chicken and my husband ordered the al pastor(pork) we were in HEAVEN!!! They also have a caddy of different hot sauces that we poured all over our burritos! Super good. The hottest one is the bright green and it wasn't so hot I couldn't handle it it was very good! Try it you won't be sorry! After the other tables left our server was way more attentive so maybe she was just overwhelmed and the food was so good we left very happy. I wish I could pick up this place and bring it home with me. The food was THAT good.

This one I must say was pretty bad. We had a craving for some crab legs and knew that Hooters had a very good price on them. This one is close to our new apartment so we drove down there and it was pretty crowded as the NBA all star game had started. \n\nOur server brought us out our drinks fairly quickly for the amount of people there at the time. Too bad we found out after she brought the drinks out that they were out of crab legs. I was pretty disappointed but I do understand that it happens, especially in a restaurant that does not specialize in seafood.\n\nAfter we ordered our meal, it came out tasting great and and while it took a bit of time to cook, I could understand. People were clearing out by this time so there were a lot of tables to clean up. We finished our meal within 15 minutes and never heard from our server again.\n\nAfter waiting for the check for about 15 minutes, I figured she might have thought we were still eating...I'm not sure. So I took both of our empty trays and put them on the end of the table. We were seated in a high traffic area so I figured that next time she walked by she would see we were finished and ask us if we wanted to order anything else or just get the check. This never happened. \n\nAfter another 15 minutes, I began to get up and stand next to my bar stool because my butt was going numb and my husband was just kinda looking around. The waitress was cleaning the table next to ours who had cleared about probably about 10 minutes earlier and by this time it was us and only a few other customers in the restaurant so I assumed she would get to our plates next. This never happened.\n\nWithin the NEXT 15 minutes she cleaned up the table next to ours, then started very casually wiping down a table directly diagonal from us, there was a guy sitting there with a drink at a table that was pulled together with this one to support a large party and she began getting flirty with him: Bending over real far to wipe the table, sitting on the stool and playing with her hair while talking to him, and making small talk while my husband and I are sitting here 10 feet away looking at her do this with empty drinks and dishes on the table for 45 minutes now. After this fiasco I had enough and went up to the front counter where another waitress asked me if I needed something and I told her i had been waiting for almost an hour just for my check and then walked out of the restaurant while my husband waited at the table to pay.\n\nShe ended up getting a dollar from us for the tip and an assurance we will never be back. I can understand at hooters the girls work there and try to get large tips out of single guys. I have no problem with this if they men and boys want to be suckers and throw their money at them. What i DO have a problem with is ignoring your other paying customers for ages and making us wait there all night while you are sitting at the table with a customer and acting like you are off the clock. Not acceptable. I've never given any server under 10% for service even if it was pretty bad until now.

Finally authentic juicy, greasy tacos! I meannnnn they were blowing my mind. \n\nJust so happens that we were going to the barber, and the wait time was 20 minutes. We wanted to grab some food, didn't really know where. So we looked on yelp with this gem right across the street. \n\nIt took a while to get our tacos but the place was busy. And you know it's good if you see Mexican folk flooding a taco shop. \n\nWe got our tacos to-go, individually wrapped. Then all wrapped in foil once more. They stayed fresh and very hot! \n\nCabezza and asada were amazing!!! The cabezza was juicy and soft, while the asada was crunchy and savory! \n\nTheir tortillas are oily and perfect in size! Small but packed with a punch of flavor! I have been here twice and can saftely say these are my favorite tacos in Orlando!","date":1522808007000},{"review_id":"mZiIc5mm9L52rwkQ0upk3Q","user_id":"dIzaU4lD0VvQMJNqC7CwOw","business_id":"8--tWZ3ovFCwT9Fs5Mjvbw","stars":5,"useful":7,"funny":1,"cool":3,"text":"Great quiet place for a cup of coffee\/tea to escape Downtown Crossing.

We thought the food was not good unfortunately (we wanted to love it), and the bill for three people was $144 - not worth it. The scallops were overcooked and rubbery, and the fries were below average. The lobster roll was not good, the crab dip was tasteless, and the drinks were not strong. \n\nThe positives were the atmosphere (fun place on the water), the music was awesome and our waitress was super cool and friendly.

I went to the Cartier store on Newbury St. and met with a sales associate.  My sales associate, Amie B., was quite helpful and informed me that my platinum wedding band bore the old exterior hallmarks that showed that it was made in Paris for export some time ago and my fiancee's platinum eternity band was an older version of a modern design.  After assuring me of their authenticity, I needed to have my wedding band sized and engraved.  She measured my ring size and took down what I wanted engraved.  She quoted me a price to perform these services and gave me a receipt for pick up.\n\nThroughout the process, Amie B. was professional, available, and seemed genuinely interested in my satisfaction with the result.  I cannot speak regarding the experiences that others may have had with a single point of contact, but my experience has been wonderful and I appreciated the personal nature of the transaction.\n\nI suppose that the overall satisfaction that I felt with my entire experience at Cartier was that after quoting me a price for sizing and engraving my wedding band, they did not require payment for either when I went to pick it up.  They honored their piece and performed all the services that I required FREE OF CHARGE.   It is rare to find dedication to service such as this and I would like to thank Amie B. for her efforts.  I will definitely return to Cartier in the future for fine jewelry.","date":1286395469000},{"review_id":"albqkNr-_E9O9kLhMYQihQ","user_id":"J80sAel_esh_MM4m1a4LYQ","business_id":"Vq6VFZg0b9HKAfrEG2-vEg","stars":3,"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"Eh, it's ok.\n\nI arrived one rainy evening to meet some friends and check out this new-fandango place.  It was certainly interesting, but the food wasn't great.  It was ok.  So that's the rating they get.\n\nThe service was alright, but the waiter was extremely bland and quiet.  It was strange for the atmosphere where I expected someone to be at least slightly jubliant.  Slightly.  That and he upsold me (damnit!) without me even thinking.  Nice play sir...\n\nAgain back to the food, there seemed to be a lot to choose from, but nothing that seemed especially appetizing.  I actually ended up getting the Ahi Tuna appetizer because it was the only thing I wanted and supplemented the rest of the meal with alcohol.  I guess that's not necessarily a bad thing, but still.  Others had the mac & cheese and were indifferent about the \"pasta and cheese-ish sauce\" as they described it.\n\nI probably wouldn't come back here, especially when Fajitas and Ritas is right there, cheaper, and more vibrant.","date":1317044065000},{"review_id":"yGRzOJ2s5h-Kcbwjmw8YRw","user_id":"OZxKo2LbzXtESW4sEvIR8Q","business_id":"AXQaXPvk5JVMyyZc5jZpRA","stars":5,"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"Fast, friendly and reasonable prices through my autobody shop.
