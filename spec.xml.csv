The rest is spent waiting.  Mainly for grilled cheese, which apparently takes 45 minutes to make.  Maybe they were furiously Googling the ingredients or something?  Who knows.  But for some reason it took an ungodly amount of time and was last to the table.

The service was also slow, mainly because as our waitress noted, they don't have trays so she couldn't carry drinks or food for 4 people, which resulted in multiple runs back to the kitchen and bar.  Which is understandable because it TOTALLY makes sense to not have serving trays in a restaurant.  I mean, how out of place would that be?  Trays?  In a restaurant?  I can't imagine.  That would be like having alcohol at a bar.  Too foreign a concept.

Anyway.  I get it isn't the best or classiest place downtown, so I cut it some slack, but an obscene wait for food and a borderline inept waitress are two things you don't want to deal with on a Thursday when you are a hung over and hungry group because you all maybe had one martini too many the previous night.",1357142378000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec2722"

After some research and thought, decided to pick a steakhouse and came across Flemings. When I looked at their restaurant week menu, I saw two filet mignon entrees. That did it, and Flemings we went. 

The place was dimly lit inside but spacious and had a warm but cool (not temperature cool...but joe cool cool) atmosphere to it. Everything looked fancy but not too snotty. It was nice. Our waitress was great! She was so professional and polite, very soft spoken but gave out a positive attitude. She was great. However, the servers (they looked like staff that went to all the tables to deliver the entrees) must have been either really busy or confused because they had our entrees mixed up between the four of us on the table. We had to clarify a few times. I guess that was one of the reason I only gave four stars. 

The food itself was good. Our filet mignon was cooked just as we requested and flavorful. Not too salty, not too bland. It was a lot smaller than I thought but it was enough since we got plenty of side dishes. Wine selection was great and my glass went perfect with the entree. Overall, we got a great deal. Originally, the main entree I got was over $40 by itself...but thanks to restaurant week, I got myself that same entree as part of a 3-course meal for under $35. YES.

I went with my son today (2/23) on a class trip and he was very disappointed. 

Families with toddlers thru preschoolers: they have a great kiddie area that (when my kids were younger) they could play in all day. A big extensive net system that lets them play above the ground. Lots of little kiddie rides for them to go on and even a kiddie roller coaster (38"" and up)

Families with older kids (I'd say 3rd or 4th grade and up) or without kids - the park turns more into a theme park for you with the three roller coasters, Mako, Kraken, and Manta. The height requirement is 54"" and they enforce it! 

Families that are just in it for the shows- there are a lot of them, with lots of different animals. 

However if you have kids that are too big for the kiddie area and not quite big enough for the actual rides and don't really care about shows--they may be bored.

On 2/23 the one ""roller coaster"", Atlantis, my son (53"" and bitter, lol) could have gone on was out of commission the entire day. So he was stuck with bland rides that definitely didn't hold a candle to the roller coasters he was desiring. 

He also wasn't into the shows, which--I mean after all the negative press, it's hard to get excited for and if you've seen one dolphin push a human around, you've seen them all.  

The food service was awful. I'll just say it. The park wasn't particularly crowded however we waited 30 mins for every food thing we wanted. I'm glad we brought our lunch bc I can't imagine how much more time we would have wasted waiting for food. 

The cleanliness was average, the bathrooms were stinky but not disgusting. 

So, before you set out, figure out who can ride what so there is no sadness on a day you're spending $80 ish per person just to get in the door.",1519425965000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec283c"

We brought the kids here for their first time, got there around 9:30 for a 10:00 opening and was glad when they opened early. However, it quickly went downhill from there. Once we were in the park, we got in line for Manta and were disappointed when the ride shut down for ""technical difficulties."" That lasted for about 25 minutes or so and many people left. Once operational, the ride itself was okay, but actually too slow for my liking. We then proceeded to try some other rides (they only have four roller coasters) and when I say that EVERY SINGLE ONE had an issue, I am not exaggerating! Kraken and Journey to Atlantis were both also experiencing technical difficulties, and Mako was temporarily shut down (when we were next in line) for an unexplained weather event as it was not raining, thundering, or lightning!!! Dark clouds should not shut down rides! Anyway....

At Journey, we'd just gotten our locker that the attendant told us we needed and when we came back he rudely told us and others that the ride had shut down and to go see guest services if you have an issue with getting money back for your locker as someone inquired. The bright side here is that we basically walked right up to everything as it was not crowded at all, which I may now understand why not. We left Journey to ride Kraken which was the best ride they have so we were able to ride it back to back as NO ONE was there! By the time we got back to Journey, it was fixed. One thing we didn't like about it was all the signage warning you that something was about to happen. No surprises here like it used to be! It kinda took the fun out of the ride.

On a positive note, we saw the Dolphin and Sea Lion shows which were pretty good and all of the aquariums and animal encounter exhibits were well done. I personally loved Antarctica and the penguins and how they let us ride into their habitat. That was really cool. 

Lastly, the park closed at 6 PM but they started shutting stuff down (stores, carts, etc) at 5 PM to try to usher you out of the park. An employee told us this when we asked why it was already such a ghost town. I have been to many, many, theme parks and have never seen anything like it. To sum it all up, my teenager described it as a broken down Six Flags, but way worse. Save your money and go somewhere else!",1537845527000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec283a"

While on vacation in Orlando I took to yelp to find us a good dinner after being sick of eating theme park food for three days! When I saw border grill I was sold. Hole in the wall local places are my favorite! Especially considering I work in one so that might make me a little biased:) 
When we got there it was packed and it made me so ready to eat some good food! All the reviews I read said you order at the counter so we walked up and stood there for a while while the girls were busy behind the counter filling drinks and using the register. We patiently waited but no one looked up.. Maybe they were too involved in their work, I don't know. Eventually a girl walked by and said have a seat anywhere you'd like. Okay, so we sit outside at one of the only available tables in the place. I made eye contact with our waitress (the one who told us to sit anywhere so she knew we were wanting to eat there) at least 3 times and still she never came out for AT LEAST 5 minutes. Being a waitress this is unacceptable leaving a table sitting not greeted that long. We listened to the table behind us complaining about the time they had been waiting for their food. Finally they wave her outside and she talks to them, apologizes for the wait and gets their food out promptly. We then think... Okay this is it she's going to acknowledge us. Nope she just walked by again. Finally when she brings them some drink refills she walks by and says are you wanting to order? Um well we need menus we've never been here and she says ""oh you want to dine here?"" 
Who knows maybe sitting outside means you want it togo but I was assuming we could sit anywhere like she said and that was the only place that had open tables. 
After we got menus and drinks everything went smooth from there- 
We used yelps check in deal to get free chips, salsa and queso! Added bonus- we got a little guacamole too! My husband is a huge queso fan so he devoured that. I was partial to the guacamole so we were both happy with that. we both ordered the Chicago burrito recommended from fellow yelpers and they did not disappoint! I ordered mine with shredded chicken and my husband ordered the al pastor(pork) we were in HEAVEN!!! They also have a caddy of different hot sauces that we poured all over our burritos! Super good. The hottest one is the bright green and it wasn't so hot I couldn't handle it it was very good! Try it you won't be sorry! After the other tables left our server was way more attentive so maybe she was just overwhelmed and the food was so good we left very happy. I wish I could pick up this place and bring it home with me. The food was THAT good. Try it, just maybe sit inside so you get service a little faster.",1420318142000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec2943"

The dim lighting and decor is very classy and chic.  Despite having a reservation and the restaurant not being very crowded, we had to wait about 10-15 minutes before being seated.  Once seated, the waitstaff was very attentive and friendly.  Our waiter knew the menu well and was able to provide suggestions based on what my friend and I were in the mood for.  Because it was Dine Out Boston, there was a pre-fixe menu to choose courses from for $38, with several items to add for an up-charge.  We started with the tuna tartar, which was nice and fresh, although had a ""different"" flavor to it which I could not pick up on and did not love.  The quail yoke on the tuna tartar was neat, but did not provide much flavor.  We also shared the porcini flatbread, which was thin and crispy with a subtle mushroom flavor-not too overbearing.  I had the scallop entree, which came with four large, nicely seared scallops over mashed cauliflower, with roasted cauliflower, broccoli and golden raisins.  This dish was delicious and not too heavy-the waiter steered me in the right direction!  My friend had the bolognese, which was a mix of veal and oxtail, served over home-made rigatoni.  This was also delicious, with right amount of sauce over the pasta and a nice portion size.  For dessert, we shared the tiramisu with dolce de leche gelato.  It was good- but I was hoping it would be better, seeing we were in the North End.  The bottom layer was overly moist and the top layers were quite dry.  Overall, we had an enjoyable meal.

I was excited about this place because there were so many amenities offered.  Before I booked, I called to ask if there were any amenities that were not offered to guests because they were owner specific, I was told no.  I arrived after a 7 hour drive.  The front desk staff was professional and engaging and the check-in was short.  There were a few rooms to choose from.  I stated that I wanted to be close to the pool.  Went to the room to settle in.  Walked in... ummmm wait a minute.  The room wasn't cleaned.  Walked into the master bedroom to find the bed unmade and the receipts from the last person on the bed and dry cleaner tags.  As a germaphobe, I was completed freaked out.  I walked back to the front because when I called, I was placed on hold.  Staff was apologetic but it pretty much set the mood and what I was to expect moving forward.  A new room was assigned.  It was clean.  However, during my stay we called for extra towels for the pool at 10a.  I looked up and realized an hour had gone by and still no towels.  Called again.  Another hour.  No towels.  Another call... 30 more minutes.  I finally decided to call and ask for a manager because at this point, I am livid.  Within 15 minutes, the towels came.  However, I was perplexed as to why we had to ask 4 times and why it took almost 3 hours.  At this point, I was ready to go home and didn't even want to stay for the last night.

The most horrible experience I have ever had at any resort. We stayed with two boys (10 and 6) and were impressed with the pictures on their website. Below is the experience: 

(a) Switch and Bate: The room we got was much older and dated than the one in the pictures. And the check in process was 45mins.  

(b) We found ants in the kitchen and bathroom, they sent pest control, we get back and the ants were still there. The room was directly from the 80's, the worst decorated room I have ever paid $200 per night.  

(c) They moved us to a different room the exchange process took 3 hours. At one point we were waiting on the street for 45mins for the bellman who was getting new keys. He came back informing us that 3-4 kids were stuck in their room because another guest locked an common door (maybe take the lock off?) 

(d) When checking out they miscalculated our discount and we had another 20mins wait till the manager finally resolved the issue. 

Honestly for 200 per night, you can do much better. I am going to call their corporate offices on Tuesday (5/27/14) let's see what they say! The four/five stars are fake or paid stooges!",1401053280000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec2945"

Stayed here on a whim because the description looked so promising. So many pools, so much to do, so many activities. This is a time share resort where they want very much to sell you ownership, and these places and their high pressure sales techniques always leave me uncomfortable. 

The place is so huge that it ought to have its own zip code. The streets are narrow, so there appears to be even more cars and bodies around. Check in time is at 4pm. Then you get taken to the overly friendly time share salesperson, who invites you to breakfast and won't take no for an answer. They extract $20 from you to make sure you show up. (After seeing the place, I sacrificed my $20.)  Finally, a bellman has you follow his golf cart in your car to find your room. By that time, it's 5pm. 

We were excited to bring the kids to play on the 18 hole putt putt course right on property. Sounds much better than it is. However, when we got to the club rental place, they told us all equipment had to be back by 5:15pm. We had 6 minutes if we cared to use them. Of course, checkout time is 10am. Which us fine if you want to get to the parks, but means you have to get up at the crack of dawn to use the other facilities. The golf stand didn't open till 9. Ok, one ""resort fee"" not put to good use. At least the pool we swam in was well heated. 

The room was disgusting, including countless hairs belonging to past visitors (owners, perhaps??) on the sheets, blankets and tub. The towels were threadbare and had rust stains that looked like streaks from somebody's butt (nice), and the shower had a crusty dried booger on the wall. We were in the ""deluxe 1 BR suite"", but I can't imagine it was any different than the cheaper studio. Scammed again. 

I would rather spend a night in my car than stay here again, and I would no sooner buy than repeatedly poke myself in the eye. But, they've called 3 times a day since to see why I didn't show up for the sales breakfast! Must've been mighty tasty.",1361484471000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec28c0"

The price of my falafel wrap was much better compared to my husband's lamb plate. For $13.95 he got a heap of rice and 2 little chunks of lamb. Again, he said it was delicious but very overpriced for the portion.

Quality, local, affordable, authentic. We ordered our food to-go so I cannot comment on the whole experience of Sofrito but what I can tell you is that the food is outstanding, the prices are way more than reasonable and in Orlando? Is that even possible? 

You order at the counter, take a number and wait as patiently as you can for the deliciousness to be brought to you. The staff is friendly, helpful, and our food came quickly. The atmosphere seemed inviting and warm, even with board games!, so I wish that we had been able to stay. This is a perfect restaurant to stay awhile and chat or to get in and out if you are in a time crunch. 

And as for the food, I don't think you can wrong with whatever you choose. I had the Media Noche sandwich, a Cuban with ham, pork, swiss cheese, pickles and mustard. Melt in your mouth scrumptious and overall fantastic flavor. I couldn't get enough. The mustard is pretty strong so be mindful if this isn't your thing. Unfortunately I didn't get to try the other dishes, but our party also ordered empanadas which received only positive feedback and the Polla A La Brasa (White), chicken with herbs. The entrees are served with three (small) sides and a (small) salad. We went with yellow rice, yucca fries and toasted plantains which were all excellent choices and I'm glad that we divvied them up so the three of us could all try. Loved the sauces that were served alongside, they were versatile enough to go with just about anything...so tasty! Wish I could have tried the empanadas and chicken, they both looked and smelled fantastic.

I'm bummed that I didn't get a chance to try the flan or Cuban-style espresso...so don't short yourself out...make sure to indulge in one of the delicious-looking desserts. If you go to Orlando and don't stop at Sofrito, all I can say is that you will miss out.",1456250264000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec27fe"

It was a pretty late decision so not much research had been done beforehand. They have a pretty wide space, and we were put further in the back, a bit awkward since we were right next to the cash register, but nothing awful. It was however early and empty enough that I was wondering why we weren't seated elsewhere.

When I first sat down I thought the beer menu was the regular menu, it's that big. The menu for food is something that just fits on your placemat, but the beer menu has pages upon pages of drinks. The guys got beers, while I got an Ice Box which tasted more like an iced coffee than anything alcoholic, and my cousin got Peach Bellini which she also enjoyed.

Although I really enjoyed my drink I found my food average. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Breakfast Club. I loved the tater tots, those were delicious, but I found the sandwich itself kind of clunky and dry. The chicken breast wasn't heavily battered, so it tasted more like a slightly floured piece of chicken as opposed to the crunchy ""KFC style chicken"" I'd been expecting. The egg was also overcooked, although I probably should've asked for over easy. But basically there were two layers of the sandwich, or three pieces of waffle bread. I thought there would be a tomato or something else with moisture in it since the egg wasn't runny, but no. Because of this I found the sandwich very difficult to eat, I had to drench the entire thing with all of the maple syrup I was given and that still wasn't enough.

My family seemed fine with their choices, and I actually had a pretty good time here despite the mediocre sandwich. I might come back again, but with a different order.",1429085167000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec2871"

So I had them pick me up the cobb salad and the baked fries.

It's not the best cobb salad I ever had but one of the best healthy cobb salads I ever had. I just wish I hadn't poured the dressing on. The dressing tasted very chemical. So I'm curious as to what was in the dress, because the rest of the veggies were crispy and fresh in the salad. I think I would have rather eaten without dressing than the one that was given. 

And those fries are good for you? I have to look into this more because I'm sorry they were delicious!! And I wasn't so medicated that I didn't know they were delicious. And fries are a red light food for me. I usually don't allow myself to have real fries because then the fry frenzy begins.

But these were flavorful and crispy. And they weren't piping hot by the time they made it to my hospital bed even. So, I would eat here again. Nice to have a healthier option that is quick and not to expensive.",1361480851000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec27c9"

I usually get the tofu teriyaki bowl, which consists of tofu (not deep fried which is HUGE in my book) brown rice, fresh veggies and a sweetish teriyaki sauce.   It's my go-to healthy option for lunch and it's consistently good every time.  

Today I strayed form the norm and decided on the veggie burger and un-fries (insert eye roll here, un-fries?).  I must admit that the fries are tasty.  They barely made it back to the office.  They were a bit oilier than I thought baked fries should be but that just made them tastier I suppose.  The veggie burger was ok.  Nothing to scream about.  I got it with everything on it which made it messy on the scale of a double whopper.  It had a bit too much of everything on it and some sort of seasoned salt on the veggie burger itself that was unevenly applied causing me to get mouthfuls of saltiness.  That being said the lettuce and tomato were very fresh and the bun was whole wheat and soft.  I think if I had scaled back on the toppings and asked for no salt I would have enjoyed it more.

While I was waiting for my burger I noticed some other people's food coming out of the kitchen.  The entrees and hot wraps looked good from where I was standing.

Some posts here say that the place is pricey and I'll admit that it's no McDonalds.  No dollar menu.  However my veggie burger was about $5 and the fries were $1.79.  The burger was huge and the fries were a normal ""small fry"" portion.  Pricey for fast food?  Maybe but it's really on par with DTX prices for a decent meal.

I think I'm going to stick with the U-Bowls and entrees from now on, but I'll be going back to UFood",1242752894000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec2793"

Small but good wine list. They were also willing to splice the appetizers together so I could try the squash blossoms with marscopone and the bruschetta. Delectable! The bruschetta had this amazing cooked spinach and a large melty piece of fresh mozzarella on top. I'm never a veal girl but completely went out on a limb with their homemade veal ravioli with brown butter sauce with pancetta and sage. Truthfully, I think all I heard was brown butter cream sauce and completely forgot about the veal. It was lightly creamy and not overly decadent in richness...and oh how I wanted to lick my plate.

This particular Unos I've been to more times than I can count and I've had at least 3 other bad customer service experiences, but the one I had tonight takes the cake.  The guy I had twice before was so negligent that I got his name from my check and memorized it so that when I returned I'd ask that they seat me anywhere but his area.

I came in today and asked for a one person booth for one and she says they don't have any so they had to seat me in the back where all the tables are.  Ok, no real problem, but I was there alone, and it wasn't peak hours just yet; it was obvious that I just wanted to eat and enjoy a meal with minimal disturbance or distraction.  And yet, she tried to seat me DIRECTLY next to another person at a table, even though the whole space where the tables were was empty.  I said no, I'd like to sit over there please (referring to a small table on the other side) and she obliged.  It just seemed like common sense and common courtesy to me.  Even in mall foodcourts, total strangers don't sit directly next to one another, let alone at an uncrowded sit-down restaurant.  

Then, maybe 10 minutes later, they came back and seated a party of two DIRECTLY next to me.  It was extremely awkward because the rest of the area was just about empty and fairly quiet, and they were so close to me.  I was irritated; she easily could have sat them at any other of the 5 empty tables and the waitress assigned to that area wouldn't have been inconvenienced.  I was going to try to tough it out, but the woman at the table turned out to be particularly loud, borderline obnoxious in my opinion.  I put on my headphones (not earbuds, but headphones) to drown her out, even though I'd intended specifically to come there to read while I ate dinner.  Could still hear her loud and clear.  I tactfully asked the waitress if they had a table available up front, and she responds, ""no, they're all taken.  I can serve you here"" pointing to the table 4 inches to my right.  I responded ""No, that would be the same thing"", trying to maintain my tone of voice.  And though my request to be moved was clearly code for ""get me out of here please! NOW."", she wouldn't oblige.  They lied.  There were tables available.  I discovered this when, only moments after they brought out my order, I quickly gathered all of my uneaten food and was walking out to leave with it.  They just didn't want to move me because of the inconvenience of either having to switch me to another waiter, or her having to serve me outside of her table area. 

My whole issue really is that they don't seem customer service centered and reading some of the other reviews, they don't make common sense decisions with their customers.  3 distinct times I've walked out of there in a huff because of the treatment.  I also agree with some of the other reviewers, they tend to take a little too long, even when it's not crowded.  I wouldn't recommend this location at all just because the service is too much of a gamble, you never know what you're gonna get.  To be fair, the food is consistent and I have had some really good waiters here and there, but again, it's too much of a gamble.",1449289379000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec27a3"

I had the small combo wings/drums in half spicy and half soy garlic. Both tasted amazing and the crispy-ness of the wings were on a whole new level from what I've had before. I have to give the prize to the spicy flavor, it's really good and not really that spicy.

It's a pretty small store for the chain concept and possibly great for those looking to experiment with Korean food if they haven't tried it before to get a taste but too afraid to go all in at a Korean restaurant. 

We tried a variety of things and my favorite was the wings (half and half) and the takoyaki (octopus balls). We tried other things such as the pork buns and korean tacos. The pork buns pork belly was very thin and that was disappointing compared to the photo on the menu. Imagine the width and length of a pinky finger. Yup. Then, we chose bulgolgi for the Korean Taco which was easy to eat and okay. The Takoyaki was crispy on the outside but still soft and warm on inside. 

Lastly, the wings. I thought the size was great. It's not too big or small for what I consider normal. I thought it was crispy and crunchy enough but not too hard. We got the half and half which is the spicy and soy. 

Overall, its a okay choice for a casual lunch or dinner. It isn't cheap either though but upscale casual food if you can say that.",1509996332000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec28d3"

Then I needed a last minute place for dinner. They never seem to be very crowded when I want to go, usually on the early side. I do love the ambiance, which is like a nice little Parisian cafe. The night I went in to meet two other people, I was early, and sat at our table watching the sun slant into this lovely gem of a room. Very nice vibe....

They had 6 rose wines on the blackboard, from France and Spain as well as the US. I ordered a flight of rose for $15, and expected those dinky little two ounce shot glass kind of things. Imagine my surprise when I got fairly reasonable pours of all three. My friends came, and we proceeded to enjoy an amazing meal. We had the watermelon and tomato salad, the kale and brussels salad for apps. For dinner we black pearl salmon, the vegetable entree (that night it had cauliflower and chickpeas, and a slightly middle eastern flavor), and the rigatoni. The latter was mine, and I have to say,  it was gorgeous, with the perfect ratios and flavoring. I took leftovers home and ate them the next day for lunch, and it was just as good. 

Then, I dreamed about it two nights later.  No really----I dreamed about a pasta dish I had in a restaurant. I had to go back. 

When I went back, I tried the Saint M reisling, which was spectacular. I've been looking for a reisling that is very dry but still has the flavor, that floral, fruity thing I associate with the wine. I was with another diner, and she had the rigatoni while I had the risotto. These change fairly often---mine was with snap peas and other green summer vegetables. Risotto is always too rich for me, but here again, I brought it home and it made a great lunch.  LAter I discovered you can order a half serving of risotto or the rigatoni, which evidently has been on the menu for like 20 years. 

Unlike several other reviewers, I've found the service to be attentive and informed, especially about wine.  The servers also have personalities, so it's like talking to real people, not automated servant bots. Prices are, to me, very reasonable for the quality of food. I like that I can get in without making a reservation a week in advance, like some other spots on Tremont.

Also treated myself to a Bellini, the only cocktail they serve. It had all the peach puree-y goodness one expects from the classic cocktail, though at $10, it was a tad pricey for the amount.

Service was consistently great, from the beginning where we were the first customers, to the end, when it got packed (on a Monday night!). This is the perfect date spot, friend spot, family spot....any spot! And the 3-course prix fixe, which allows you to choose from anything on their menu, is one of the best prix fixe deals around.",1286379334000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec2910"

There are so many dishes on the menu that I want to try like the pork chops and vinegar peppers.
At The Saratoga Cafe, also known to locals as BYOB, has no corkage fee when you bring in your own bottle of wine! 
Update June 2018: The lobster diabolo was enough to share.  I ordered the sauce on the less spicy side and was perfect. I substituted the pasta for veggies. The lobster included 3 big shrimp, calamari, clams, and mussels! The sauce was so flavorful. This was a special and I wish it was on the daily menu. For $30 it's a steal! My husband had the ribeye with fresh grilled veggies. He ordered medium rare which was very pink on the rare side. A true medium rare. Order medium if you want pink and not cool in the center.",1528504327000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec2917"

They could use some more people who enjoy working there. I couldn't feel the pride nor the funny bone that usually is part of the HOB team.

This one I must say was pretty bad. We had a craving for some crab legs and knew that Hooters had a very good price on them. This one is close to our new apartment so we drove down there and it was pretty crowded as the NBA all star game had started. 

Our server brought us out our drinks fairly quickly for the amount of people there at the time. Too bad we found out after she brought the drinks out that they were out of crab legs. I was pretty disappointed but I do understand that it happens, especially in a restaurant that does not specialize in seafood.

After we ordered our meal, it came out tasting great and and while it took a bit of time to cook, I could understand. People were clearing out by this time so there were a lot of tables to clean up. We finished our meal within 15 minutes and never heard from our server again.

After waiting for the check for about 15 minutes, I figured she might have thought we were still eating...I'm not sure. So I took both of our empty trays and put them on the end of the table. We were seated in a high traffic area so I figured that next time she walked by she would see we were finished and ask us if we wanted to order anything else or just get the check. This never happened. 

After another 15 minutes, I began to get up and stand next to my bar stool because my butt was going numb and my husband was just kinda looking around. The waitress was cleaning the table next to ours who had cleared about probably about 10 minutes earlier and by this time it was us and only a few other customers in the restaurant so I assumed she would get to our plates next. This never happened.

Within the NEXT 15 minutes she cleaned up the table next to ours, then started very casually wiping down a table directly diagonal from us, there was a guy sitting there with a drink at a table that was pulled together with this one to support a large party and she began getting flirty with him: Bending over real far to wipe the table, sitting on the stool and playing with her hair while talking to him, and making small talk while my husband and I are sitting here 10 feet away looking at her do this with empty drinks and dishes on the table for 45 minutes now. After this fiasco I had enough and went up to the front counter where another waitress asked me if I needed something and I told her i had been waiting for almost an hour just for my check and then walked out of the restaurant while my husband waited at the table to pay.

She ended up getting a dollar from us for the tip and an assurance we will never be back. I can understand at hooters the girls work there and try to get large tips out of single guys. I have no problem with this if they men and boys want to be suckers and throw their money at them. What i DO have a problem with is ignoring your other paying customers for ages and making us wait there all night while you are sitting at the table with a customer and acting like you are off the clock. Not acceptable. I've never given any server under 10% for service even if it was pretty bad until now. If I do decide to go back to Hooters it will not be for a very long time.",1361500555000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec2957"

The Wave Restaurant opened in June 2008 in the Contemporary Resort at Walt Disney World.  The restaurant is on the lobby level and features space for a couple hundred restaurant guests and a FANTASTIC 40-person bar with small side rooms off the main bar that are cool, blue, hip and excellent.

The biggest key unique selling point here is the menu and the amazing food.  The food was based on a background of restaurants in the pacific northwest for inspiration.  In Oregon and Washington, sustainable eating is a bigger movement, and here at the Wave the focus is on fresh, seasonal food with huge flavor frequent organic influences...and the like.  Yes...I am writing this about the food at a major restaurant inside one of the icons of Walt Disney World.  This place is a massive departure from what you would expect.  No fries, no fried food.  But don't think it's all healthy in a dull way.  There's an amazing pork tenderloin, freshly crafted creamy soups, excellent desserts, and...for my money...the single best margarita I have ever consumed.

The fresh fish with edamame salsa and the citrus and avocado salad made me come back for a second visit.

I ate there 4 times in a week at Disney.  Not only is the food wonderful and the bar very attainable for dinner seating, but the prices are especially fair in the theme park context. They'd be fair in any context, in any city, on any block.

I had 3 main issues: one, they made us wait past our reservation time and when we were seated there were many open tables in the dining room.  Two, the dining room was very large and quite noisy, even at 8:00 at night.  Still not a deal breaker. My main issue was with the ambiance.  With a restaurant called The Wave, with a waiting area that is all lit up in ocean blue, it was very confusing to have an orange and gold, retro vibe throughout.  Kind of confusing.

I ordered the eggplant parmesan, and it was rather tasty, but it was a 3""x5"" slab on a plate with a light red sauce. No side pasta, no nice mozzarella topping. It looked like it went from the freezer to the plate. It tasted average.

The decor was beautiful (+1 star). It feels like you're a cast member of the Godfather, minus the bullets.

Would not go here again, not even for a biz lunch. I would rather go to Vinny T's!

Brown Sugar, in my opinon, had fallen a bit so I was not sure how great Thaitation would be.

I was wrong.  Thaitation is just delicious.  Brown Sugar is no longer a place in my go to restaurants and I have convinced all of my college friends that it is no longer worth the trip and Thaitation is the place to be!

I've eaten in once but order delivery regularly. Delivery is always on time or within reason, which I appreciate. 

The Old Lady Spicy with shrimp (my #1) Pineapple Cashew Shrimp, Fishermans's Madness, Drunken Noodle and Mango Fried Rice are among my favorites. Their soups, specifically the wonton are always a pleasant addition to my order and the honey glazed spareribs are delish. 

My only complaint is that I like really spicy food and most of the time it's not as spicy as I like it. I ask for it to be really, really, really spicy and sometimes it is but most times it's not. Maybe my tongue is dead from all the spice.

Appetizer : Really good fried pickles... And that says a lot from me because I don't like pickles outside of a hamburger bun! 

Meal:  Vanbarry's Bacon Jam burger. The burger was perfectly cooked (rare-medium). The beef was high quality. The bacon jam has kind of a sweetness that offset the bacon's salty side. Kind of a caramelized taste. The blue cheese was perfect with it. I decided to try the sweet potato salad as my side,  because I've never heard of it. It was really sweet and creamy. It was really tasty but not quite as chunky as I prefer for my potato salad. The flavor was great and I'd definitely have it again. 

Oh, the beer was cold and good too! :-)  

As an aside,  the band/singer was really good! Kind of a Dave Matthews type. Great voice. I missed his name but I told my wife thst I could see making Sundays on the open patio a regular event to listen to enjoy the music and food.

Our destination of choice?  Ma Soba, a pan-Asian and sushi restaurant in Beacon Hill.  Opened in 1999, the restaurant has an impressive array of awards.  Needless to say, we were pretty excited to try it out.

We were greeted at the door by a friendly face, but his was the last smile we would see that evening.  Our server ignored us for several minutes after stopping by just long enough to fill our water glasses, and when she did return, only wanted to know if we had ""decided what we wanted"".  She took our order and left.  Not that she didn't do her job well; she was tremendously efficient.  Our water glasses were full all night, and she timed the courses perfectly.  But a smile and a little hospitality certainly would have made us feel a lot more comfortable.

We hit a home run with our appetizers.  My boyfriend ordered the pork gyoza, and they were crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside.  My miso soup was excellent.  For our main course, we split the Shogun Boat, which consisted of eight pieces of Sushi, fifteen pieces of Sashimi, a Tuna Roll, a Caterpillar Roll and a California Roll.  Now, we knew Ma Soba was not the top sushi restaurant in Boston.  It's not too pricey, so we knew not to expect phenomenal sushi.  With that in mind, we were very pleased with the presentation, the selection and the quality.  We were quite content after our main course, even if our server had yet to crack a smile.  

However, the biggest disappointment was yet to come.  We ordered the green tea mochi, and we were horrified when my boyfriend's fork made a resounding ""clank"" against  it as he tried to cut into it.  I attempted a bite of my piece, but after chunks of freezer burn ice fell into my mouth, decided to follow my better judgment and send the mochi back.  We were disappointed that the restaurant even served us such sub-standard fare.

We left disappointed.  The sushi itself was as expected, but the service, the awful dessert and the lack of ambiance in the restaurant ultimately left us unsatisfied.  I doubt we'll go back.",1255405691000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec2727"

My friends swear by the pho here, but I rarely deviate from Bun with Pork when I have Vietnamese (which is probably my favorite kind of pork EVER), and last night was no exception. One note is that Pho Hoa's Bun didn't have just pork as an option, so I had to go with the pork plus spring roll... I have no problems with the spring roll, it's kind of like getting a bonus app with your entree, but that extra fried bit tends to put me over the edge of fullness so I usually prefer just the pork option (plus the pork is my favorite part so the more of it I can get, the better). My Bun was delightful (it looked especially impressive here for some reason, the components were arranged so artfully), but I could have used a bigger container of nuoc cham, and also prefer my nuoc cham with slightly less red pepper flakes. But overall a solid tasty version with no major complaints from me, and comparable pricing to anywhere ($7.75). My dining companions of course really enjoyed their pho, and it did look good. Also, they served us cold tea, which was really refreshing on a hot summer day and a nice unique touch.

Service was spotty here though, they were good when we first arrived and our food came speedily, but we couldn't find anyone to initially take our order and then to get/take our check, which was annoying. I'd say Pho Hoa is a solid choice when you're looking to be in a bit more upscale environment, but I don't plan on turning my back on Pho Pasteur any time soon.",1306505018000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec2892"

We chose the Peabody due to its close proximity to the convention center (the most convenient location) and stayed here from a Sat to a Fri. We arrived extremely early on Saturday and luckily they had an available room for us. I wasn't a fan of the smaller room (and I'd be the one hanging out in it the most) so we upgraded a notch and got a larger room in the Mallard Tower. It was very spacious with a separate seating area and a vanity for me! Yes, the Mallard Tower is the older building, but when we looked to switch to the newer tower due to our a/c not working so well, I didn't like the size/layout of the room. We decided our current room was better. We had another minor glitch in that our fridge was not working, but that was fixed by giving us another working fridge in the room.

Should I need to return to Orlando to be near the convention center, I would stay here again. The convenience factor is huge, but the service is what sold me. It was impeccable. Every single person is incredibly accommodating and nice! Really made our hotel stay and minor blips easy to get over. Although I wish the rooms had coffee makers. Another plus are those like me who do not have children. Luckily, there are two pools. The grotto pool is the huge one w/ the waterfall close to the parking structure. The quieter lap pool is also large and catered more towards adults. I loved this area. While the husband was in his classes, I was relaxing by the pool. More hotels need two pool areas like the Peabody. I also got to check out the lovely fitness center (didn't use it), and used the spa twice. Wish the spa was larger with a hot sauna as well as the steam sauna.

Peabody also has a few restaurants. I recommend Napa for lunch and dinners. B-Line Grill was gross and Capriccio not very good either. I also recommend self-park. I'm normally a valet girl b/c I'm lazy, but every time we valeted, it was backed up and took forever for our car to come out. The parking structure is conveniently located a short walk from the hotel. It was faster and a bit cheaper to park this way.",1373674541000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec2777"

I came here for a conference in July and found that with all the wings in this hotel it can be very confusing to get around and get lost. Also there was a dance competition going on at the same time that seemed to bleed into our area.

The food supplied at lunches and dinner was good every time, no real complaints. A little better than standard hotel conference food- however one of my roommates for the conference was a vegetarian and she was not happy with the tofu option that was provided at EVERY meal.

Next, I found the pool to not have very much space to accommodate enough people at all. We went outside at 1pm and found not one single spot to sit. This would dissuade me from coming back to this hotel.

The food in the restaurants was very expensive, hard to find  quick cheap lunch in our off time. Additionally, the bar they had open at night by the entrance to the hotel was VERY expensive for a drink. I am talking 13-17$ per drink. No thank you.

Lastly, my biggest issue was the bathroom in our hotel room. It was great and all that a TV was in the mirror- not gonna lie, that was COOL. However, there were slots in the bathroom door so there was no real privacy at all. It was like the slots on a closet door? I was rooming with some people that I was not as familiar with and I was turned off by this- especially for how expensive it is to stay here!

1. make your food and drink prices realistic $17.00 for a burger that would be $6 at five guys or red robin.  People would stay on property and eat there $6.38 for a beer ridiculous   charge $7 for a burger and maybe $2.50 for a beer sales would go up 800% and profits would soar
2.  The $27 a day for Valet parking and the cluster when parking is very chaotic and pisses people off.  get a system that works and this should be included in the resort fee $23 a day so take that $60 a day in fees and give people something for it food credit in the restaurant drink credit for use at the bar, Something !!!  
3. stream line check in. never should it take 30 min to give someone your money, a lot of room to improve here maybe even have self check in kiosk set up for people that are tech say enough to type in and swipe a credit card.

It went south right away when we found ourselves waiting five minutes at the hostess stand to be seated. When she finally did appear, there was no apology or explanation offered. The place looked to be about half full but perhaps they were short staffed?

We did get our drinks ordered and delivered quickly (ok one good thing) but from there it took 50 minutes for us to get our food ordered and out from the kitchen. I went with the sliders and my table mates both got the grouper sandwich. 

My sliders arrived luke warm at best, had stale buns, were overcooked and lack any flavor. As a side, I picked homemade chips that were cold, not crispy and again not really tasty. At this point, we were late to get back from lunch or I would have sent everything back.

However, for the main I got beef enchiladas with red salsa ( they were out of green salsa, along with half a dozen other menu items, but I'll chalk that up to opening weekend wrinkles to iron out). The red sauce was very dark and tasted bitter and burnt. The meat itself was good, although the tortilla was mushy and didn't really add anything. The rice was also overbooked and bland, and the refried beans could have been out of a can. The entire entree was a major disappointment.

Overall, this place has lots of promise, and mostly has everything in place except for the food. I hope they can fix that issue, because this could be a very good restaurant.",1290395522000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec28df"

We were excited to eat here before trying to catch the Rivers of Light show.  

Our dinner reservation was at 5:40 since we were trying to catch the 8:45 show. Unfortunately we arrived about 20 minutes late due to the bus running late.  Fortunately they were able to accommodate us.  The inside of the restaurant is really nice, each room is a different art gallery dedicated to conservation.

I figured that still arriving at 6 would be plenty of time for the show but for some reason the hostess had us wait.  This was strange since it was very empty.  15 minutes later we were seated.  

Having been on safari in Africa I was excited by the menu as it had a lot of exotic meats.  We started with the charcuterie platter as a starter. I went with the duo of venison which had a venison filet and boerewors (South African sausage).  My wife went with the SA lobster enhancement and the Gobi cauliflower.

I would say i was a little disappointed by the platter and my entree.  The starter was very small and the vension and sausage were not bad but served cold.  I will say that the lobster was amazing and so was the Gobi.

I think the worst part of the restaurant has to be the service.  From the lackadasical hostess to the waiter which took FOREVER for dinner service unbelievably we did not make the 8:45 show.  On top of that it was one of our pricier meals that weekend.  

Overall this place is definitely nice and the food isn't bad.  I think the exorbitantly long service and price make it just Ok for me.",1524860264000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec291b"

The restaurant  has three dinning rooms and is very spacious so we didn't have wait long for our table. During the short walk to our table we got a brief description of the room we would be dining in. We dined in the Grand Gallery which was very decorative with beautifully designed lantern animals on the wall that followed an animal/planet conservation theme.

We were then greeted by our server who gave us a rundown of the menu. I had made sure to mention to her that it was our second time dinning at Tiffins, just in case there were any changes made from our previous visit. (We liked it that much we had to come for a second visit). She informed us that there had been a few changes to the menu such as replacing the Duo of Lamb with the Duo of Venison and switching out the Grouper for a Swordfish.

After thinking long and hard about the menu, we finally decided on two entrees: The Pomegranate -lacquered chicken and the Seared Hokkaido Scallops.  As we waited for the food to come out, the server brought out some complimentary bread for us to snack on. It was Pomegranate Focaccia bread, and let me tell you, it was very unique and delicious. It was not too fluffy, but a slightly more dense type of bread. It also was also lightly glazed with a molasses sauce which gave it just the right amount of sweetness. In addition to that, there was a dipping sauce made of molasses, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and hints of pomegranate which gave it the right amount of tanginess. The server had told us to use it sparingly because a little went a long way. But It was so delicious! We even got seconds on the bread.

My entrée was equally as delicious.  The food was plated beautifully and the taste was on point.  The chicken was nicely flavored and moist. It pretty much fell off the bone and went great with the Sweet Potato Pap. The Thumbelina carrots were also super cute and yummy.  The Fennel salad was a great compliment to all the flavors and textures of the dish.  I tried a piece of the scallops and they were so good! We also ordered a side of Brussel sprouts which came in a pretty decently sized considering it was a side.  There were bits of bacon pieces in the Brussels which made it even better!

Overall, an excellent dinner filled with great food, great service and a very warm and welcoming atmosphere. The prices are a little on the higher end, but all very worth it. Located right outside of the new Pandora attraction. It's perfect if you are looking for a fine dining experience in Animal Kingdom.",1496779505000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec2918"

I dined here solo and was given the most hospitable experience I believe I've ever encountered at a restaurant. The hostess was kind and seated me without a reservation, my server was nothing less than awesome and told me so many beautiful details about the restaurant I wouldn't have known, and I even sat next to some amazing people who actually worked in the restaurant and were dining on a day off.

I ordered the Lunch Tasting Menu ($49) with a Vanilla Passion Fruit Iced Tea which came with a side of Vanilla Bean Simple Syrup so you can control the sugar level. 

The first course was a trio of a black eyed pea fritter, sous vide octopus, and butternut coconut milk soup with shrimp. Everything was exploding with flavor, and I was sad when it was gone. The octopus was fork tender and the sous vide process was utilized wonderfully.

The main course was from a selection and I chose a vegetarian ramen dish with a mushroom broth, vegetables, and a siracha lime sauce. Spicy, flavorful, large portion. Can't complain about an awesome bowl of ramen!

Finally was my favorite -- the dessert trio. Deconstructed cheesecake, guava mouse, and a ganache with Egyptian sea salt. As a pastry chef, I understand and appreciate the refinement that goes into a well-executed plate of dessert; all 3 of these were spotless on flavor, presentation, and variation of texture.

The sophistication of this meal belongs in a high-end restaurant that can compete in NYC or anywhere easily.

I tried the curry a little while ago and came away very impressed. Spicy enough to be interesting, but not annoyingly hot. That's pretty rare, for me. I would very likely get the full plate if doing so did not mean I'd have to skip out on getting a wrap.

The lemonade iced tea is probably my favorite of their drinks. It could stand to have more lemony flavor, but as an iced tea, it's very good.

This is one of those places that has so much great stuff, and varying menus for brunch, lunch and dinner, that I just couldn't decide on when to come and what to get. I eventually went for the awesome looking brunch menu and ordered way too much for two people:

- Pulled Pork Corn Muffin ($6)
This is listed under sides, but it came out first and was a really delicious start to the meal. It's less like a corn muffin, and more like just a ton of pork with some guacamole on delicious bread.

- Sunrise Poutine ($15)
I told myself that this was a starter, so I wouldn't feel horrendous for ordering three entrees. This is way more than an appetizer and is a meal on its own. This consists of a hot pile of fries covered in scrambled eggs, gravy, cheese curds and Canadian bacon. I often regret ordering poutine when I'm left with half a plate of pure mush and sogginess, but that was not the case here at all - this was some of the best poutine I've ever had, as the fries remained super crispy throughout and were incredibly good combined with the salty Canadian bacon and the fluffy eggs.

- Sunnyside Burger ($15)
As if we didn't get enough bacon, egg and cheese with the poutine, we also had this excellent burger with plenty more of the same piled on top of it. This was a really outstanding burger. The sunnyside egg on top was nice and runny and was just perfect with the bacon and American cheese.

- Southern Belle French Toast ($12)
Another really excellent choice, this french toast came with two huge, juicy chicken breasts on top of it. The jalapeno jelly was a little strange, but aside from that, the chicken and french toast combo was just as good, if not better than the standard chicken and waffles.

It's a pretty hipstery crowd with hipstery, slightly lazy service. It's a fun, energetic atmosphere though, which combined with all that delicious  food makes you look past these slight flaws and yearn to return to try more great stuff.",1389926610000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec2770"

I liked that when you walk in not only is there a retail section of glasses and other things but there is a bar where you can do tastings. Also a bakery section in the back. It had potential. 

Waited about 10 minutes for a table which wasn't bad. Our server was Heidi and she was nice. Not too attentive but very helpful. Ordered red sangria, friend got the sparkling wine flights and they were both OK. The sangria was too sugary.Nothing special which is crazy since they make their own wine and that's their thing. Maybe I'm just use to the bottle wines I like, who knows. Appetizer was Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps. They delicious. The amount of chicken was not enough for three people but it came with onion crunches, chopped cabbage mix and delicious cucumbers. For dinner I ordered the flatbread and salad combination, Carne Asada flatbread and Caesar pesto salad. The salad was really really good. I didn't really taste much pesto but it was faintly in the background which added so much flavor. The flatbread was perfect. The bottom was crunchy and the meat was very tender. My friend ordered the wild mushroom and chicken risotto. The risotto was very tasty. Got to try the ooey gooey butter cake and it was so good. Ha everything was so good ! I would love to come back and try more things. The lobster bisque soup was calling my name.",1484426305000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec27a9"

Hands down, best chicken wings in Boston. Monday they are 25 cent wings, lucky for me it's the day I always go. Meaty and juicy with a handful of different flavors. Also, they have a a 7 dollar coors light pitcher. You tell me where else in Boston you can get that! I'm still looking. 

My only gripe is that the jukebox has been out of service for the past 6 months since I discovered this joint.

Lunch is a great time to go as far as their lunch specials.  You can order 2 sushi rolls from a good selection for $8.95, and for 3 rolls I believe it's under $12.

Their service is something that this restaurant can do so much better.  There's typically only one server up front, and depending how busy it is - you could be waiting a while to get your food and check.

Food is eh, nothing special. Had the Mamacita burger, needs more flavor. Uburger still better.  Will return to try tater tots, other entrees though because everything is reasonably priced.  Big tvs is one section, and at the Siensa bar.  Something for everyone!

It's new, clean, and big place.  Prohibited (the underground speakeasy) is pretty cool.  Love the big couches, good place to chill.  Cheesy christmas lights and mounted game head make it a laidback scene. This would probably be 2 stars without Prohibited.  Worth checking out, great addition to symphony area overall though.

That sandwich is honestly one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! It's got a chipotle mayo that is just incredible. It's been about 3 years since I've been here but I still crave that meatloaf sandwich all of the time. I did have the Mac and cheese at one point and from what I remember, that was great too. I'm really into Mac and cheese so I almost always try them at restaurants but usually am disappointed because I can make better, which was not the case here. I'll definitely be paying Parish a visit when I'm back in Boston.",1524858503000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec280d"

A couple months back, I had the pleasure of going to the Water Grill in downtown Los Angeles, a restaurant that holds 1 Michelin star (at least when they had a Michelin guide in LA). It was very good, but in my opinion B&G Oysters is definitely better. We ended up at B&G at 5:30 on a Saturday (the only res we could get a week ahead of time). It seemed like a great place to take my aunt and uncle while they were in town doing touristy things. 

For our apps, we ordered the fried clams and the mussels.The fried clams were clearly pretty fresh and the dipping sauce was great. The mussels on the other hand were spectacular. We agreed that these were some of the most tender mussels that any of us had ever had, and they were quite flavorful as well. 

For our entrees, my aunt and uncle both ordered some fish that they had never tried before, ordered the salmon, and my girlfriend ordered the lobster roll. The lobster roll was quite good and very lightly dressed (the way I like it). She also had coleslaw and fries on the side. While the coleslaw was pretty standard, the fries were very good. I loved that they decided to opt for tarragon and cilantro on the fries. For my salmon, I have to say that this was easily the most crispy fish skin I have ever had on a piece of fish. The fish itself was quite tasty as well. Oh...and the sauce...the sauce, so good. The chorizo added an element of saltiness that I thought was welcome and often lacking from fish in restaurants. We opted to avoid dessert and go out for ice cream instead, but overall it was a fantastic experience. The service was generally good as well.

The food was fine. It was good - nothing special, that is, it's the stuff you find at many other places (burgers, fries, etc.). This was good and for that I'd consider this place again. Then comes the service. The orders for the table were incorrectly brought out: from the drinks, to the food, to finally the bill. The wrong beer was brought out - they apologized but instead of only bringing out the correct order, they brought out the correct order and charged for their mistake. The food was fine, and the drink refills were fine. Then when the bill came, we were all charged for a portion of 3 beers, even though their mistake included 2 beers. After bringing it up, they gave us grief and took over 20 minutes to try to fix it. it was so awful considering two of those beers two people offered to pay for and the other one no one knows why they added it to the bill.

The Kenpachi was sold to us like a salesman sells a car, ""This is the only place in FL"" and similar statements. It was a $46 dish that tasted like a salty, squashed and seared frozen fish fillet. The veggies were stated as, ""from The Land"" in Epcot. Who knows if that's true, but they were under cooked. I like them with a bit of crunch but they were more hard than anything.
The New York Strip was ordered medium rare and it came well done. Our waiter said it was good that we sent it back because it was a viened piece of meat. This brings me to a different complaint. Why are the people that help us make our order not the ones that bring it to us? As a customer we are left wondering what to do until the waiter has time to check on us.  
The lobster tails were not the melt in your mouth that these Nova Scotians expected. Lesson learned, eat lobster where lobster is freshly caught.
Now for the good - my husband LOVED the Chilean Sea Bass. The appetizer of Cheese Evolution was fun to try and share. So 2  stars for those dishes.

Brunch: my four friends and I were all thrilled with our meals. I had the blueberry pancakes and they were amazing--flavorful and buttery with crispy edges. The bacon and coffee were incredible, too. My only critique (and it's super minor!): the sugar bowl is fully stocked with artificial sweeteners and only 2 sugars. Our table asked for more sugar and was given another bowl with the same setup. Strange ratio. Also, with such high quality coffee, I was surprised not to see liquid sugar on the table. 
Dinner: We were seated promptly by a friendly hostess. A sweet and personable waitress took our drink order. But then we had another waitress--who was a tad intense. Our group had pizza and burgers and were all happy with our choices. Our waitress forgot about us after a male friend of hers came in to visit. It was odd--she stood a few feet from us, but was too engrossed in her conversation to notice we were done with our meals.

I can't believe no pictures of it are posted on yelp yet-posting one now. Anyways, I'ma big mushroom fan so I may be biased but I swear the seasoning with this soup...hands down...best---evahhhh!

The rest of my meal was fantastic but I just kept daydreaming about my portobello soup. When will I be able to eat it again? What's in it? How can I recreate that at home? Okay, anyways, on to the rest of my food! I had the Cedar Plank Roasted Wild King Salmon with spring vegetables, Citrus-Miso Buerre Blanc, and parsley oil. It came out perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned. One of the best salmons I've ever put in my belly! I can't remember what dessert I had...but it was just meh. I'm a huge chocolate dessert fan and they didn't have anything super duper chocolatey the way I like it. The meal was pricey---so be prepared. We were on the Disney Dining Plan so didn't mind the money...it's 2 Table Service credits on the Dining Plan.

Service was excellent and it was smack dab in the middle of the Wilderness Lodge which is absolutely gorgeous! The decor reminded me very much of Frank Lloyd Wright with the lines & nature. I'm a huge FLW fan so I loved it! Take a stroll outside after dinner to watch the geyser and then hop on the boat back to Magic Kingdom!",1290393608000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec2781"

For those of you that are unfamiliar with the DDP it is a prepaid dining package that you can purchase if you are staying in a Walt Disney World resort. Essentially you pay for your meals in advance and if you are a crafty diner -like me- you can really get a lot of bang for your buck and end up saving some money in the long run. So take my review with a grain of salt because I went BIG at Artist Point and did so without regret. 

Of all the WDW eateries Artist Point is firmly entrenched in my top three. Artist Point gets huge bonus points for featuring an extensive wine selection from the under appreciated Pacific Northwest. I'm a pushover when it comes to a good wine pairing and always ask my server to match a glass to each course. Since they are trained in this and I am not I leave it to the professionals. 

I am a big fan of the artisan cheese course and like a typical American I treat this as an appetizer instead of an end of the meal treat. The trio of cheeses covers a safe yet broad selection of fromage including a nice cheddar, a creamy goat and a tangy blue. This was matched nicely with an Oregon Pinot Noir. 

There are two dishes Artist Point is famous for; the cedar plank salmon and the buffalo. Choosing between these two wonderful dishes is almost a Sophie's Choice caliber decision. Of course if you know that Artist Point has an off the menu surf and turf option where you can have both you won't have to decide. It's kind of like getting your burger ""animal style"" at In-N-Out because unless you know to ask for it you wouldn't know it is there. Both dishes are wonderful and served in smaller portions when combined so you can enjoy both without being wasteful. 

Desserts leave a little to be desired at Artist Point. The signature berry cobbler just doesn't do it for me. The chocolate cheesecake and the clafouti (a rustic baked custard pie with fruit) are better choices.

Artist Point is a popular restaurant so make sure yu contact Disney Dining for a priority seating time.",1228279912000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec28a5"

When a chef sees numerous plates of UNEATEN food returned to kitchen and doesn't find out why... They clearly DO NOT CARE!!!
They are ""trained chefs"" and plated  over cooked fish and beef and served it to us!!
INSULTING! DISGUSTING!OBNOXIOUS!!

TAKE YOUR MONEY AND SPEND IT SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!! THE TABLE does NOT deserve patrons with the overcooked food they intentionally served us...

Not to mention when we finally commented on the over cooked beef, they could have cared less.

I am so disappointed because I like to support local restaraunts ,especially who use local products. BUT I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING The Table!!!!

SIDENOTE- I went with friends who were repeat customers and said their first experience was AMAZING! However the experience this time was disappointing to our friends as well! A restaraunt  that isn't consistent at that level of ""cooking/dining"" experience is NOT acceptable.

I got there earlier than my brother and sister-in-law and decided to try a mix drink since the other yelpers had mixed experiences about them. I spent that $10 for you, readers. And didn't finish my watery dark and stormy (was there actually alcohol in it? I couldn't really tell). I was seated at a corner table downstairs, underneath an overhang. My brother only bumped his head on the ceiling once or twice, and the protruding corner after one beer. The beer list was decent (saving grace?).

We split the fries with truffle oil for the appetizer, I had the tuna salad, sister-in-law had another salad, and Bro had the much hyped lobster mac n'cheese. Hm. 

The fries were hot, that's always nice. I could *kind of* taste the truffle oil, I guess it was a nice little addition to the fairly run-of-the mill fries, but that's pretty much all I can say about it. This might be a nice thing to get if you're just there for a drink or two (get beer or wine for yourself, seriously, avoid the mix drinks) and want something greasy to go along with it. 

The salads were decent but overdressed--the lettuce on mine was good lettuce but I couldn't taste it because of all of the oil! The tuna was done really well, though, by really well I mean almost completely rare, which is how I roll with tuna steak. Maybe a straight up tuna steak would be good at this place, I'll never know. 

Ok, on to the Mac N'Cheese. Seriously guys? All those people who raved about this stuff--do you really like the cheese to pool at the bottom of the bowl rather than being thick enough to be included in each bite of the food?? The taste was decent (I mean, cheesy lobster is really tough to eff up) but I thought the consistency was pretty nasty. The thin creamy cheese didn't make sense in a signature dish, and my brother started to wonder if he even likes mac n'cheese at all after how bummed he was about his meal. Trust me Bro, let's go to Zaftigs and get some real mac n'cheese before you make up your mind on that one.

I arrived one rainy evening to meet some friends and check out this new-fandango place.  It was certainly interesting, but the food wasn't great.  It was ok.  So that's the rating they get.

The service was alright, but the waiter was extremely bland and quiet.  It was strange for the atmosphere where I expected someone to be at least slightly jubliant.  Slightly.  That and he upsold me (damnit!) without me even thinking.  Nice play sir...

Again back to the food, there seemed to be a lot to choose from, but nothing that seemed especially appetizing.  I actually ended up getting the Ahi Tuna appetizer because it was the only thing I wanted and supplemented the rest of the meal with alcohol.  I guess that's not necessarily a bad thing, but still.  Others had the mac & cheese and were indifferent about the ""pasta and cheese-ish sauce"" as they described it.

I probably wouldn't come back here, especially when Fajitas and Ritas is right there, cheaper, and more vibrant.",1317044065000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec295f"

We started off the meal with their philly cheese steak spring rolls. (I did not make that up.) The concept sounded ridiculous- but I have NEVER enjoyed a philly cheese steak more (and I'm from PA). Wanting a lighter lunch, I ordered their French Onion soup which was fantastic- perfect portion to fill me up and still make me feel light enough to finish the day. Luckily, my coworkers ordered their infamous mac & cheese so I could steal a few bites. It was refreshingly light, yet flavorful- cooked to mac & cheese perfection. I loved the atmosphere- with a loft-style layout, nice Euro-feeling bar when you walk in and unique artwork that makes you keep the kids at home. I will definitely return here for lunch (or dare I say dinner), and call it another success of Downtown Crossing!

P.S. After being inside all morning and wanting a little Vitamin D- I was irrevocably happy to find my myself sitting underneath a ceiling of windows beaming sunlight on me as if I had opted out of going to work and instead laid by the Charles and relaxed.

I, being a member of the latter team (read: clumsy), did not do well here. In my defense, it was my first time. 

A little background first. Personal shortcoming- I suck at chopsticks. I can play piano, paint fine detail, french braid hair, write in fancy scripts, yet somehow I haven't mastered the ability to grasp rice with two sticks. Eating here at Kaze was like every embarrassing chopstick failure I've ever had, but amped up to the Nth degree. Basically, I found myself trying to skewer what appeared to me to be raw cold cuts, cooking it in boiling broth, losing the coldcut in the broth 3 or 4 times, overcooking it while frantically trying to fish it out, and quickly shoving it into my mouth, with broth gracefully running down my ladylike chin. Awesome. The payoff, in terms of tastiness, was not comparable to the effort it required, IMHO.

My dining companion, who was attempting to explain protocol, was appalled. He had to remind me several times not to use the same utensil that I originally picked the raw cold cut up with. Okay, so I suck. I suck at chopsticks, I suck at Shabu Shabu, and I suck at life. 

Truth be told, I just wasn't into it. I don't see myself trying this again.

We've gotten numerous things over the past few times we've been here, but these stand out.  

Old Bay Crawfish: 1  1/2 lbs of whole crawfish seasoned w/ old bay. served w/ lemon $9.00 Not as flavorful as Boiling Crab, but still good.  I actually think because it wasn't drowned in spices, you can actually taste the flavor of the crawfish.  

Mixed Crab Bowl: 2lb snow crab, 1 lb dungeness crab clusters, and 1 lb king crab legs w/ drawn butter.  (all weights are prior to cooking) $84.00.  This was definitely a splurge. I was a bit hesitant because 4 lbs of crab isn't necessarily a lot and restaurants usually overcharge.  I was pleasantly surprised when the crab that came out was practically all meat.  The crabs were cooked just right, the meat was juicy and warm, and the overall digging in with our bare hands and riping up the crab was just right down our alley.  It took us a bit of time to devoure this feast so by the end legs were starting to get a bit cold.  It was still overpriced, but if I had another celebration to attend at this restaurant I would not hesitate to order this dish again with someone.

If you are looking for amazing crab you'd very much enjoy it here!!!",1480815913000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec28a2"

I was having a similar difficulty getting the name to pop up on Yelp! Anyway we arrived @ 5 pm on a Thursday to an almost empty but relatively cozy restaurant. Funky but interestingly decorated I felt comfortably ready to enjoy a fusion experience. My wife selected our choice for our dining experience & in my desire to walk into the unknown I lead the way.
Our arrival was just before the masses of reserved patrons & their dinner times. I tried to get reservations but the earliest was 9:30 pm & me being of the morning person persuasion I'm usually putting one foot into the sack by that time!
My call for a reservation was rewarded with the valuable info that if we showed up early we could sit at the bar in front of the chefs preparing dinner...kinda like a sushi bar. The ""waiter / mater d"" was very friendly & attentive and provided us the lunch menu (since we were early) and the drink menu with the soon to be ready dinner menu...we got the big spectrum treatment. My li'l woman ordered a sake mojito (darn good but a touch more octane would have been nice) and I ordered a caraf of chilled junmai sake with the green papaya slaw w/ chili, peanuts, lime & cilantro...noted w/ 3 stars as HOT!  I'm a seasoned chili pepper enthusiast  or ""chilihead"" & found it mild to my palate. Our waiter brought me some of the Thai chilis that they use just to ""sweeten the deal"" and I grew happier as the experience progressed...yes the sake helped too.
Dinner came quickly and we ordered the wok-roasted mussels ...ooooh yeah they were awesome as we're the Taiwanese Dan Dan noodles then came the steamed bao... oooooh so gooood! If I had less control & more room I could have gone further but restraint prevailed. I was very content and so glad we came thru the rain and hurddles to experience the wonderful food and the passion @ which it was prepared for us. The staff was friendly, helpful and informative so this restaurant has my fondness & support so I recommend you get yourself in there and have a good time!",1340674161000,"61aca64ba536b27596ec28ea"

To begin with, our hostess was friendly and accommodating.  Our server was easy going, also friendly, and helpful.  The decor felt like a mix of retro and Asian influences.  We were a party of four and had the cripsy spring rolls and braised pork belly buns, which were fun and tasty!  We also had the dumplings (our favorite dish!), the chicken udon noodles that were a bit spicy but very good, and the chicken wings (good), plus sides of rice.  The drinks (mine a Lotus Flower--delicious!) were creative and yummy.  And then for dessert we had the coconut cream pie and the vanilla bean parfait, both of which we felt like we could have done without...neither wowed us.
